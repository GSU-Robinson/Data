5,"You will enjoy working here, especially if you are the creative sort of person."
5,"Great Place to Work.  One of the Best company to work.  Team members are supportive, Caring. Ultimate goal  is successful product release. Everyone Jumps in to this effort."
5,"Great place in all ways. I feel well equipped to handle independent work environments. Leading the technical win on enterprise accounts. Adobe has empowered me to present, sell and plan for all C-level meetings. Understanding the value of all Experience cloud solutions and how best to listen to customer needs was core to all enablement at Adobe."
5,Adobe is a great company to work for.  They have a culture where people are encouraged to be innovative and come up with new solutions to leading edge problems.  They provide excellent compensation and benefits as well.

5,"Adobe is a growing company with tons of opportunities. Unfortunately, the group I was in had awful culture. My manager would use improper language to criticize how I look in my employee picture, and she never really worked with me to develop a plan for my career growth even if I was fully prepared to discuss.  "
5,"The remote culture made me ( as a new hire) had no one to interact with everyday in the office. I was always alone even though most people in my team were based in the city that I was located. I couldn't build any relationship and I couldn't experience any Adobe culture other than joining the company meetings. People were gossiping and were speaking ill of others behind their backs, which is so unprofessional. If you are looking for a great working culture, then I don't think Adobe is a good place for you."
5,"I was hired in December. I knew that Adobe was a good company when I applied but as I found out more about it during the interview and job offer process, I was absolutely amazed. The benefits and perks are easily superior to any other company I’ve ever worked for. I have been in technology for over 30 years so I’ve worked in good jobs for a number of good companies, large and small, and Adobe has really wowed me."
5,"Great Products, extremely good work-life balance. Management crossing teams are totally different. You can see lots of gaps between teams. Work for a younger team is lucky."
5,Prefer not to disclose.  It could be that it was just this particular group.  Planning takes too long.  THere is too much focus on detail and it slows down the project.
5,"Every team member that I had were result oriented, getting job done perfectly was the goal in everyone's mind. Helping each other with all heart out was amazing."
5,I love working at Adobe!  The benefits are top notch and most of the people are amazing to work with.  The CEO is always inspiring and active in the press.
5,This company is such are large company but fun place to work.  The company itself is growing really fast and one year is different from the next. Always looking ahead.
5,"Adobe is a fantastic company, and I've enjoyed working for them.  They have fantastic leadership with integrity, strong company values, and they're hugely supportive of charitable causes.  I only wish they supported flexible hours or working from home more."
5,I've worked with a supportive and fun group of people. The culture is very inclusive and they encourage people to collaborate and learn from one another.
5,"One of the best places to work. Adobe truly lives up to its values of Genuine, Exceptional, Innovative and Involved. The people are talented, smart, driven and kind. The culture is supportive, inclusive and engaged. The leadership is insightful, forward-looking and has successfully guided the company through its largest transformation in history, reaching all time record profits and revenue."
5,I had to fill out all these questions because your automated service registered 'Adobe CC' as one of my prior employers. It was not. It is a series of digital editing software.Just wanted to clarify in case this comes up and affects me in a serious way.
5,Provided lots of training and perks
5,One's experience can be very different depending upon which team he/she is a part of. Overall culture was to take good care of employees. Good benefits and a lot of events.
5,It was a learning atmosphere where individuals wouls collabarate to the best of their knowledge. 
5,"Adobe expects a lot of out of its employees. That is a good thing. You are challenged daily and given great opportunities. They also understand you have a life besides work. That being said, it's not a rest-and-vest company. Expect to work hard. It's worth it."
5,"Working at Adobe, the pace varies by the business. There isn't a typical work day which I love. Working in Sales, Adobe allows you to be a brand within a brand which I love. I have a manager that allows me to jump in wherever I feel and learn. This enables me to develop my position outside of the job job description. The culture in NYC is every bit of the feel of family. We are very close; work hard and play hard. It is a very collaborative, team environment. The hardest part of the job is when you lose deals. It feels personal when you see your teammates lose a deal or not be able to close a deal. I enjoy everything about my job. I love my manager, he is absolutely the best!!! He is more than a manager, he is my family. I love my co-workers. When big events happen for them, they happen for me as well. When they hurt, I hurt. I LOVE MY JOB!!!!"
5,"Adobe's a great company because of their benefits, culture, business model, CEO, and people. Most of the locations are state of the art, with excellent cafeterias, gyms, and other on-site benefits.  Adobe's financial performance is hard to duplicate. They've achieved double-digit growth for 3+ years, which is difficult for a company of their size and age.  Most of this growth is due to Adobe's migration to the saas model which, while controversial at the time, has allowed them to considerably increase their revenues, especially within creative cloud.  I would strongly suggest working for Adobe."
5,No dedicated training which placed hardships to employees that had never trained or onboarding due to their own deadlines that impacted my training.
5,Contractors are treated as second class citizens. All contractors are not provided a dedicated workspace which forced us to compete with other contractors that had no dedicated workspace. This caused animosity between  contractors Because I would show up very early.
5,"Dedicated workspaces were only asigned to full time employees, where there were an abundance of but not allowed to use forcing users to do complex tasks on a tiny laptop screen. Of course I just go with the flow. I found this very unusual for Fortune 100 best place to Work."
5,Program Manager for Channel Marketing Business Segment
5,"Love this job.  Great Company to work for at the time.  Worked for the original Software inventors.  Adobe is changing the world through digital experiences. We help our customers create, deliver and optimize content and applications."
5,Great place to work but beware if you are a contractor then you will be the outcast. FTE's do not eat lunch with you and they look down on you like you are not good enough to be a FTE
5,Great working environment. The office was super modern and my team was great!
5,a good sense of timing and visual awareness.
5,a mixture of practical and creative skills.
5,IT skills.
5,"A typical day was working with clients and teams members and working on objectives. Being in a management capacity, four to five meetings a day was common.  I learned multiple management styles throughout employment.  Workplace culture is open, honest, culturally rich and full of employee experiences (engagement opportunities). The hardest part of work was dealing with changing organizational leadership and strategies on localized levels, not at the Adobe leadership level.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a vast array of amazing and wonderful people both directly and across geographical locations."
5,"Great work culture. A lot of inclusion and events, however can be quite distant from everyone else. People don't really communicate much besides when an event comes."
5,"Adobe has a wonderful culture. As a writer, I appreciate constructive, not destructive input, and that's what I got from Adobe. I had to learn a lot of new technologies and took them through a lot of transitions. They are my favorite client of all time."
5,Rare combination of having good work life balance and being to work on the interesting cutting edge problems
5,Great benefits
5,A pure Bay Area life style of working on cutting edge technologies in a fast paced environment with the big brand. Lead by experienced management. Still growing  gradually and expanding by acquiring companies.
5,"This is a great tool to use if you are a video editor. Amongst all other competitors, I feel like Premiere allows every producer to do whatever they desire."
5,I didn't work for this company I would if I had the chance to do so. something any computer person would want to do. that is about it wasn't hard really fun co workers
5,I am currently a project analysis at Uber. The thing I like most is working at Uber is everyone is nice and helpful. There will always be more work everyday I come in but everyone makes it seem to be enjoyable and fun.
5,Adobe is a great place to work.  They accommodate with their employees and work as a team to get deadlines done on time.  I really enjoyed working with a great team of peers.
5,"The company overall is a great company to work for.   My organization was a little flat, with not much room to grow to management position.  But I did learn quite a lot while I was there."
5,"I loved my time spent with Adobe. I was there for four years. I'm only leaving because of family circumstances. I believe that if it had not been for that, I would have stayed with Adobe forever."
5,Worked closely with a team of IT Technicians.
5,It was a great experience working there. The culture there and the people were all great. You can attend volunteering events and Talks made by the company. There are lots of teams with different projects and every team use multiple technologies.
5,"Adobe lacks leaders...it is managed by people, who abuse authority. In the race for EEE, Adobe  ignores to place real leaders for strategic positions. And most of the Sr Directors, Directors and Senior Managers, abuse their position. The CIO has not demonstrated any leadership qualities and the focus is only to staff with own peers, instead of finding the right person to lead. iN the desire for raking in Fortune100 list, quality, leadership and fairness is comrpomised"
5,Employees are very professional and pull together to get a project complete.  
5,"Work in a Scrum, Number of Calls. Work hours were very collaborative. Manager and Team members were helpful and inspiring. it is a fast paced environment."
5,Learned new type of languages to create adobe products
5,Adobe provides an atmosphere that allows one to pursue your creative side to be your best both professionally and personally. The company is large so there is plenty of opportunity to move up.
5,Scope to improve timeline management. Team members are helpful.
5,Good environment to learn and grow. 
5,"Open culture, great environment to get experience."
5,"Great people to work with, and always something new to work on. They take great care of their employees. There are many great benefits, and they keep you engaged."
5,Awesome benefits ranging from health care to wellness reimbursement programs. A lot a great minds to work along side always pushing you to learn more. Adobe really does take care of their employees.
5,"AMD has been around a long time and a nearly all innovators in the silicon industry have spent some time at AMD. AMD’s engineering innovation is fantastic, while the company has occasionally suffered with management missteps. Currently the company is doing very well, but Intel is a very hard company to compete against so be realistic about your planning."
5,exceptional work and product line which motivates engineers to work hard and beat the competition.  
5,CEO of the company work very hard to turn around the company.
5,Fortune 500 company that has enough room to grow quickly and make a great career. Environment is highly competitive and can be challenging at time but has many opportunities to grow and shine
5,"AMD has an amazing Austin Texas campus equipped with Starbucks, cafeteria, full gym, outdoor basketball courts and parking garage. It has many teams and holds it's own as a Fortune 500 company in the silicone industry"
5,"The culture, management and opportunities to develop at AMD are outstanding."
5,"If an account is short of goal, rest of organization must make up balance to attain corporate goal."
5,"Your overall work-load and career advancement opportunities really depend on what team you are a part of in Global Ops and what your rank is. After being hired at the most entry-level position in the Product Planning group, I was eager to work and take on new tasks, get recognized, and move up quickly. I felt that the first manager I had did not support my ambitions and actually tried to restrict me from taking on more responsibility. After 3 months I had a new manager and she seemed a little more invested in finding opportunities for me to grow, but I have also had 3 different directors in the span of 1.5 years and they have all seemed relatively unconcerned with helping me move up."
5,Daily work was always manageable. The work in process was monitored real-time and we were able to schedule our work assignments to meet the production requirements. I learned a great deal about many of the technologies involved in the overall manufacturing process.
5,Was promoted three times in the first two years. Was offered on-site training to improve skills as well as given the opportunity to find my own career-advancement training which was paid for by AMD.
5,Great place to learn and work on many different things but work-life balance can take a backseat with often aggressive deadlines and sometimes understaffed and overworked teams.
5,Company runs on Moore's Law. 
5,"Too many middle managers, not enough working staff."
5,"I cut my IT teeth there, and learned much from many fellow employees."
5,If you want to go to a place where almost everyone is very intelligent and driven then work here.  If you want to skate through a job then you will be weeded out naturally - the culture is driven and thrives on getting things done - and done right !
5,"Overall a great company.  Coworkers are great, but there are some bad apples that have negative outlooks and make it hard to work with.  Make sure the employees you work with are legit and aren't egocentric."
5,Liked it there. The team was great; opportunities were there; the management gave me direction and support. What else is there to say. It was a great place to work.
5,"The most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting new people, very diverse culture, and a great way to continue learning new things"
5,Poor Business Processes
5,Organizational Churn
5,"Bathroom breaks? Not encouraged. Safety? Unless you’re jumping on totes or climbing bins, doesn’t really matter to them."
5,Full time is a lot more demanding and tiring. It’s a Lot of strain on your body and lots of lost time with family if you have kids or people to care for
5,I really liked job and that it was fast paced. benefits and pay were great. Amazon tried to always show appreciation for our hard work. unfortunately relocated and had to resign.
5,"It's a terrible deal.  Yes, you can publish your ebook for free, but then Amazon takes up to 70% of your profits!!  It is impossible to make money with free ebook publishing on Amazon."
5,Amazon is good for added experience on my resume. They have good job security as long as you are a proficient worker. The job benefits are good as well.
5,First experience in the CS field and gained a lot of valuable experience while working there on the development cycle for software improvements. Great location too
5,Great work and pay
5,Great working environment and fast paced so you keep busy
5,"Nice place to work with good pay, hours and solid management. They offer persk for employees off and on the clock and are a great company to work for all around."
5,While Amazon is a great place to work where you'll meet great people the management likes to keep the employees in the dark or weren't truthful about daily progress or why they did certain actions. Makes it frustrating when you ask if you can advance to something for months and the only response you ever get is 'I'll get back to you on that later.'
5,Everyone at AWS speaks the same values - Amazon Leadership Principals and being evaluated based on them. Its great environment for technical driven professionals with aspirations to help customers\partners to embrace cloud technologies with extreme high pace of innovation.
5,"Fun and enjoyable place to work at, met a lot of cool people. Managers are very helpful and kind. Help me with any concerns. Kept me busy throughout the day and made day go by fast."
5,Good workout while your working. You stay busy and there's never a dull moment. They truly care about their employees. An ideal place for those who are looking for long term employment. They also help with education as well.
5,"Great pay and benefits, plenty of opportunity to move up in Amazons ranks. Easy work, but can be long hours, but in my opinion one of the best company's out there!!"
5,I had a great team effort where not a single person would leave a assignment for someone else to do yes it's a great experience I wouldn't change anything about the choice I made to become an amazon.com employee
5,It has been a great experience working at Amazon. The people there are kinda and truly help out when you need it. I enjoy the manual labor that goes into unloading.
5,Pretty fast paced and tiring but very solid work experience. Being a supervisor was pretty cool of an experience being more of a leader and someone to make sure everyone was doing their job
5,"That’s literally the only problem, everything else is actually great & the environment is great as well. It’s just management like I said it needs major work."
5,The job was 10 hours a day 4 days a week except when we needed overtime then it was 5 days a week you are expected to get a certain amount of work done which means you had to work fast. You have to be efficient at what you did when you did your job you had to do it right but it was a good place to work be prepared for a lot of walking
5,Too many people in a small warehouse   Management not on the same page with each other  Does not communicate changes very well with them  Employees Can never get the same answer from anybody
5,Amazon employs some of the most intelligent people I've ever met.  The influential people in my day to day are an integral part of my success with Amazon.  I have grown so much as a working professional with this company.  It will be hard to top working for this company.
5,"At work , I learned that presentation of packages are assential to customers and quality.One must consider the customer at all times when in high volume packaging settings."
5,Employee suggestions are discarded. People are afraid to give honest feedback 
5,Favoritism and office politics
5,good place to work    fast paced but have music to motivate you  prizes sometimes given    team work is also there  exercises daily to help from stiffness
5,Great place to work and advance. The pay is good and the managers are very cooperative. They have good deals and low prices every day. Amazon is the best.
5,"I got some experience about online selling, I was working full time because it was online, I had my own business, I had communication with all people from all over the United States,I was very happy that I  could provide some product to people and make them happy  mad many friends, It was fun"
5,I love Amazon and it's for sure the best job I've ever had. So many benefits and incentives and great people to work with. Awesome experience every day
5,"On a daily basis, we inform you about senior-level positions matching your search criteria. To do so, we analyze the job listings of a vast amount of companies and headhunters. Our service exclusively focuses on the job market for executive positions."
5,Promotions are difficult
5,"I did a 1000+ packages a night, while others just sat around on there phones, so called 'ambassadors' who got paid more! It was far. Took 1 hour 1/2 to get there"
5,If you can work long hours and like a repetitive work flow this would be for you. If you are not already physically fit then you will be while you work there. Happy Hunting
5,In-depth insights to advance your career
5,"It is a good job to have if you want exercise while your working, with good benefits and decent pay. You must be able to have a good driving record and drive a van"
5,"Me siento feliz ver tenido estas experiencias,pero no deseo trabajar más de noche"
5,"You are just a number at amazon, and they will not hesitate to fire anyone over the smallest thing. I worked with an elderly lady in the receive department, and she was literally about to hit her 5 year milestone. She was told to help the pack department because nobody showed up (which happens often because nobody likes working there), and even though she was there to help and save the managers butts, the didnt even hesitate to terminate her for not making rate. Coincidence? Definitely not. They knew she was going to reap the extra benefits of hitting 5 years, so they did all they could to get her out the door. This kind of thing happens all the time at amazon. Its how they operate on a daily basis."
5,"You scanned a bunch of stuff for weeks and then your throwing pallets around like their nothing. Throw your back out, call in for a couple days and get threatened with termination, nice."
5,"•Knowledge of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Phases such as Requirement analysis, Design, Development, Testing and Deployment with working knowledge in software development methodologies like Rational Unified Process (RUP), Agile, Waterfall across the span of various projects."
5,"•Strong Experience with Workday Report Writer - Custom Reporting (Calculated Fields, Advanced, Standard Reports) And proficient in building HRMS modules like Talent, Time Tracking, Benefits, Compensation and Payroll in Workday."
5,a fast paced work environment for which you stow packages to areas that get sent to their destination great management. They care for the safety of the workers
5,"A typical day at work there is so many options to do there, there is a large diversity of worl to do there you never get bored.  We 1st all start at sand up which is where we all gather together before the shift starts and we stretch and talk about how the day should be going and then we clap it out and chant to something and then we start our work"
5,"Good place to work for everyone.. flexible schedule, lots of good benefits but not as before they had. Have paid and unpaid vacations.. they have career choices like medical, technician & CDL license..........."
5,"great co workers, fast paced work, lack of opportunity for growth, limited time, various positions available, great nursing station, great if offered for long term, not seasonal positions"
5,Growth and Advancement can be achieved by standing out amongst your fellow peers.  Peak Season is the best time of the year a show of amazing TEAMWORK to get the job done.
5,I always had a awesome day at work Never had a problem with the job or associates. It was an great place to work and the managers are good and reliable
5,It’s a very stable job if you have a good team everything works out even with the different personalities. But it’s a great place to work at and can grow from too.
5,It’s Very awesome work experience I love working there part time. It’s usually work there part time seasonal I’m currently working back there now since  06/28/2019
5,It's a great career job to be on move up in your position learn a lot at Amazon so many different positions and they help pay for school and they care for your child.
5,"Loved working here for 5 years. Communication can be frustrating, leadership and people move often so continuity is an issue. You drive your career here."
5,Show up and do your work..it's like a typical day at work I like. I will apply again. My hours got cut short and they and didn't have any this else available to get more hours. However I am a good worker and was asked to come back to rejoin the team.
5,"The job is not that bad you'll usually work about 4-5 hours a day if you work at the center in Euclid, a paid 15 minute break is included. But if you cannot stow (place a lot of packages in a container using a poor android phone that barley works) at a certain rate within an hour (it's like 300 or something like that an expected to go up) you will be terminated. "
5,"The stow rate is ridiculous, the requirements are crazy. I understand you are getting paid fairly good, but the expectations are not even worth $15 an hour. They find anything and everything to complain about and will single you out for things you cannot control. "
5,Trying to switch teams is a dangerous thing. You have NOT to tell your manager until the process is complete or you'll be in danger to be pivoted.
5,Amazon is a job that you can make as much money as you want during Peak Season.  Volunteer  extra time is offered to all employees and you can work numerous shifts. Opportunities for advancement is offered to all employees continuously.  Great company for  young and older individuals who are fit and able to work fast pace.
5,"Amazon is an amazing teacher.  It is not always the most cuddly place to work, but you are surrounded by smart and talented folks who use a lot of data and analytics to make complicated decisions."
5,Amazon was a great job experience. I met a lot of people who I am still close to. Working at Amazon you build a team and your co-workers become your family.
5,"Fast-paced, collaborative workplace with opportunities to learn new tasks regularly; easy to adapt to changing conditions as the entire warehouse works as a team."
5,"Great work system, I loved working for Amazon. I loved to work for Amazon because they are very open to ideas coming from the work force. The ability to grow within the company was also very good."
5,I load and get set to be on the road on time I have the support from my main staff and I know I can rely on them if a problem were to ever arise I know who to go to.
5,I was a contractor for 9 months so most of my knowledge is from such a perspective.  Very good at allowing autonomy working remotely.  not too many meetings overall.  Very poor onboarding process.
5,"It's all about what you make it. Amazon is culturally diverse which works well for me. After initial training, there are other opportunities to be trained for. Just ask."
5,"management was the biggest issue here.  they really have a high demand and will fire you for just going to the restroom. I spent 6 years thee, because a 'project manager'  and they never gave me a raise or actual promotion, but I still gave them my insight and helped develop several tools, systems and new ideas to help drive customer service while maintain a low cost effectiveness approach, to a wide verity of facilities that eventually went world wide and saved the company millions. and at the end?  I headed the projects, built them from the ground up …. and not only was I never offered a promotion, but my ideas where stolen from me and given to other employees with no experience and used to promote them instead. and my name was never mentioned... I was the creator of all of it, and  my fellow coworker, the ones I trained, all got promotions. this lead to my submission of my resignation and I forfeited my involvement with them and moved on"
5,Managers they are understanding and if I have questions they always take the time with answers. HR is the best they answered  (my thought was crazy) but asked anyway and they understood without making me feel like it was dumb. All in all I enjoy working for Amazon
5,"The company was a great place to work for. I was going through a lot at the time I quit, and my manager wasn't very supportive of me and influence my decision of quitting. Working there was very fun though, they had a game room to play video games and a break room with a ping pong table and pool."
5,When the season job finish they just grab you without any explanation like you a criminal and let you sit in the office . Then they tell you to thank you for your work .. that’s was disrespectful for the hard working ppl there
5,"Working for Amazon was the most enjoyable job since high school! They provided sufficient paid training, advice to help adjust to working at home, tools and resources to do the job required, opportunities to learn more and advance within the company and they provided a majority of the equipment.  My trainers, managers and co workers were simply amazing!"
5,Career change opportunities and benefits are why I want to stay with Amazon.
5,"Fast pace, is not for everyone..."
5,"I learned how to build pallets, communicate with me people, it’s a hard work environment but you just got to stay positive, the managers will always check up on you"
5,"I love working for this company,   They Offer great benefits. The only issue is transferring to our new location in Florida due to my wife's company move."
5,It was fun and competitive to see others break records. It helped motivate me and helped bring out the best in my performance. A job where I was always looking to improve.
5,Never a dull moment in this position.
5,"Really good company, u have breaks , lunch time, u can work voluntary extra shifts and also voluntary time off that they offer everyday, Pay is really good and always friday without doubt. "
5,Amazon was a cool place to work at the hours and the pay was good it was cool part time job I just got a full-time job that conflict the hours conflict
5,I love it. It Is an  easy pace job with great pay. In the position that I work beings though it is part time their is any pat advancement opportunities. BUt their is nothing hard about the actual job itself
5,"I think Amazon BDL 5 was very accelerating.  For years prior I've been trying to get that warehouse feeling back.  Amazon fulfilled that for me, with the exception of the PIT instruction that was stressed during the orientation.  I was told that I get instruction on how to operate the familiarize piece of equipment, for Amazon warehouse.  Besides the technical greed of wanting to say I was a pot driver. It's a great workplace."
5,"It is rough when you are low level, but if you progress it gets way better. It is great to work from home, but they micro-manage you. If you are patient and you progress, it will get much better."
5,learning new things and keep me going to have improve my skills everyday. 
5,my communicate is my key and sometimes can be difficult and purple vri if I need. write note for simple things
5,"Paid is decent. Definitely not a place for advancement if your over the age of 20. They must pay the labor board to over look the workplace discrimination laws, they break them daily. Air quality in the facility is bad and not check on a regular basis."
5,The hours can vary being flexible but you're working from home.
5,"This company is amazing and offers sooo many benefits to its employees from the tier I and upward. However, this specific fulfillment center is AWFUL! The work load is easy and it's just full of shoes, however the building management promotes and encourages a toxic work environment among leadership. I regret trying to obtain this Tier III position."
5,vending machine need change to healthy food
5,..........Ok place to work.Promises of hiring for permanent then postpones often.Training is minimal.Little room .....................
5,I am an independent contractor.
5,I enjoyed the teamwork with amazon and had some autonomy with my position.  I will miss my teammates and hope I was able to traim my replacement sucessfully
5,"I like their culture and environment .it is a very good place to work , they give you opportunity to learn more things and to grow. but most of management positions were outsiders."
5,"I was a Pick/Stow Ambassador so i always got to teach the new hires how to Pick/Stow correctly. I thought the job itself was pretty easy, its just you always had to be on your feet and keeping up with the pace that Amazon wants."
5,"If you are prepared for long hours, mediocre benefits, constant monitoring, good pay, competition, stress and lots of manual la or - Go apply directly at Amazon- not through a temp agency."
5,The job is okay wasn't really what i expected to be. It has its slow days and fast days. Its a four hour shift but sometimes you only work 3 hours the good part about working for Amazon is the VTO without the points and it gives u room to grow gain new experiences without having the previous experiences
5,Typical warehouse work. I wouldn't recommend it as a career to anyone. There is a high turnover rate for a reason. The work can be stressful but it's a fine stop-gap.
5,Delivering packages with a smile and seeing my customers happy and saying they get excited when they see the Prime trucks pulls up makes my day! 
5,"good job very intense work they will keep you on your toes. when i was there it was a good place to work and enjoy your work,good company to progress within"
5,"I enjoy my job. It's physical and because of my health issues I can not work full/part timr, so I work a shift they have called Alpha. And it allows me to supplement my income without having a regular schedule. I enjoy everything I do I can do all jobs I have suggested to both my children to apply, they did and they LOVE it too. I would suggest Amazon to anyone looking for a good paying job, with flexibility."
5,I had a lot of fun doing this job. Wish it would have been extended. They were always willing to work with you if you had things to take care of. If you like fast paced work then this is for you. I loved it because it allowed me to be there for my kids.
5,"I have great attitude, ability, and security to work and to Learner everything you teach me or training."
5,"I worked as an SDE I. It really depends on the team that you're on, but my team culture was quite difficult to work with. Significant amount of oncall, Not much recognition from management, and working long hours is the norm. Senior engineers are not friendly, which makes it hard to learn."
5,It is a fast paced environment and you have to meet a set rate of production. The benefits are great and begin on start date. There is opportunity for overtime year round and you are required to work 60 hour work days between Black Friday until the new year.
5,"Lots of over time if wanted , you are just a  number in the warehouse nothing more , managers don’t care about you just care about numbers , Boring job"
5,"My experience as Amazonian was good at the beginning but, once new managers came aboard it wasn't the same. The short time I worked there I worked every day so hard but to the new managers it was not always good enough"
5,Nothing to say about the company....of you enjoy standing in a box for 11 hours a day. Than the ts the job for you. Most people hate it but a few enjoy it
5,Picker 
5,This place was held to work for! Do not go their management is horrible. I was sexually harassed and they did nothing about it. You are forced to do 125% or more when you're picking items off of racks from one side of a warehouse to another side of a warehouse. You are monitor for bathroom breaks and they have GPS trackers on your scanner and questioned you constantly about everything. You will hurt your back you will hurt your feet and you will be in the worst pain ever this job is horrendous and they do not care about their employees because we are all replaceable and the pay really sucked when I work there now it went up some but they treated us like trash
5,"Very awesome place to work at , its very chill and not uptight like a lot of jobs and major companies. Very respectful and understanding managers and team leaders."
5, nothing I could improve on except it was taking me 30 seconds longer to pack a box than what they required.  
5,Great place to work. They really understand what the employees need. The breaks were well thought out. And the managers were really there to help you out.
5,"I found others in my orientation, saying the same thing, 1 guy got written up 2x without even being told, he didn't find out about the written warning until he wanted to transfer and couldn't because of the write up."
5,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon but my hours were never secured depending on the workday flow I would get maybe 2 to 3 hours a day they would always offer VTO due to lack of work. People in charge would take advantage of there power, giving women who were flirty and loose more easier task to accomplish. Or they would purposefully leave you alone when the belts were full to capacity. Not to mention the many dangers of boxes flying off the conveyer belts at top speeds so many flew right off and caused injury."
5,I was a warehouse worker unloading trucks and packing stacking and moving things around to get the packages and things loaded onto the truck to be shipped out
5,"When I walked into Amazon, it looks like a prison, there is 20 TSA type metal detectors when you come through the front door, no one smiles..ever! You have to climb several staircases to get to your assigned station, many times, someone else is already there, so you have to walk back to square 1 to get assigned again, then they put you at another station that more times then not, has a DEAD wall, no items to scan for at least 20-45 min. Meanwhile, the whole time your being tracked, they want at least 180-240 scanned items an hour, ever hour, and you work 10 hour days. Your station is often missing boxes, tape dispenser is not working, items are missing from bin, so you can't complete your order, it's dead silence in there with just the sounds of machinery, conveyor belt and beeping of scan items, except for 1 RED BUTTON everyone presses when something goes wrong or items are missing, so it's a loud siren going off in your ears constantly, but for that, extremely mundane and boring, so most people take and are encouraged to take caffeine or any stimulants to keep you from resting and to keep you going at a robotic pace, trouble is, its incredibly HOT! and humid with all those machines and bodies in there. Caffeine does the opposite with me and make me tired or if I take too much, I get on edge, my heart races and I can't sleep the next day. So the only time my number were good was when I was on Caffeine and unfortunately it didn't work half the time or it would make me so sick. You only get one 30 min. lunch and two 10 min. breaks, but by the time they call those breaks and 100's of people go single file all at once, up and down stairs and through metal detectors to a breakroom, you LOSE many of those minutes and this job more than any NEEDS those breaks, because unlike most jobs, it's 0 downtime. Even a prize fighter can keep going for 10 hours straight."
5,You need to work with Amazon to know their work style.As a member of AWS team i serve as the sourcing expert for a group of job families we are actively recruiting for Premium Support. The teams consist of Cloud Support Associates and Enginners along with TAM's. I have significant influence and impact over the delivery of sourcing and pipelining while fostering a collaborative environment to ensure a great candidate experience and raising the bar with each candidate hired.
5,Amazon is a clean safe inviroment to work at.nice pay and good scheduling hours.i would recommend to my friends to work there.good pay and vacation time
5,Amazon was a fun and fast paced environment for anyone. They offer great benefits and a food court alone with a fun environment for everyone with great communication between management and workers.
5,"can be good at times but overall its do working with the right mind set.alot of walking, stress on the knees and mind.same work paste everyday.no challenge, same thing everyday"
5,Environment is clean and obey the safety conduct. The supervisor and the team lead are excellent. My team are great too. They have a good pay rate as of 2014/2015. They are simply the best then
5,I enjoyed working with all the people that worked in our area managers were very helpful if you had any problems they helped me become faster at my job
5,I just got tired of call centers. I wasn't about it anymore. For someone that can handle it then I would definitely recommend but also they are very strict about bathroom breaks which is a deal breaker.
5,Inspect the items to ensure that they’re not damaged or missing any parts
5,Its a fine place to work. You might get promoted if you have a good performance. Those who like packing boxes can do this job. It is a very physical and hard working job. You need to have lots of stamina.
5,learned to work the scanner
5,made sure that each item after being scanned was on over with correct address it was to be delivered too
5,management was very down to earth with discussing any issues
5,Package them accordingly 
5,The management staff had unethical work related practices and it extended from lower management to the head of the facility. I was illegally terminated but haven’t yet filed any legal action.

5,Working at Amazon is really easy. Benefits are nice and the pay is great. Hours vary from 20-25 hours a week to 60 hours on certain occasions. Always room for advancement.
5,Amazon is a great place to work if you don't mind being on your feet for 10 hours. The pay and benefits are a plus especially if you have children. ?? it.
5,As a seasonal delivery associate 90% of your day is spent inside a vehicle by yourself. You'r responsible for delivering all of you packages in your entire day. There are 2 paid 15 minute breaks and an unpaid 30 minute break. You are able to take your breaks when you choose. Perfect job if you don't mind driving and being alone.
5,but if your just starting out in the work force or just getting out of high school then its a great job.
5,Cool job. It’s physical but not unbearable. Roll w the punches and management will always have ur back. Lots of overtime. Cool co workers no dress code.
5,"Everyday is a good day at amazon. We begin with stretches, share safety tips, and began work.  I love that you work in all areas, and the time flies by quickly"
5,Great management and a job that stresses your best interest. Nice benefits and overall a really good job. The only drawback is it’s a very boring job. They let you work up to 60 hours a week.
5,Hard work but rewarding. Average walking was 12 miles a day or more. Awesome team environment. Great benefits. Opportunity for advancement if you’re flexible and willing to move.
5,"I didn't work directly with Amazon, I worked for them through 3rd party company. Amazon employees were very judgmental of my job as if they were better than me and my coworkers since we were the cleaners."
5,"I enjoyed the fact that the work was rather secluded. My first managers were fantastic and very understanding and accommodating. About 6 months into my employment, the warehouse rotated managers and my new one was very unfair. Work conditions during winter were nice, but during summer it was too hot for how physical the work was, especially in dock/truck areas. The policy for time off task was not very fair."
5,"I enjoyed working for Amazon. It was fast-paced, breezy, and I was able to remain goal oriented. There was always a new prize for over achievers. For instance, one might win a $50 cash prize if you exceeded the goal to unload packages in a certain amount of time."
5,I would love to return to amazon as soon as my 90 day probation period is up I know they'll give me the chance to return and prove what a reliable worker i can be
5,My experience working at Amazon was a learning one. I enjoyed working there as this was the first time I was hired on full time for a job. It's a very friendly place. I love how fast paced the task we're it allowed you to build your focus and time management.
5,"The job had its stressful days but there were many pleasant distractions there in between calls to unwind throughout the workday. These Distractions included Pool Table, Ping Pong Table, Air Hockey Table, Gaming Systems, and Shuffle Board along with many others."
5,"The manager and culture at that location were great during the early morning shift. The day shift was less enthusiastic, and much heavier items."
5,was involved in site set-up. i was a subcontractor working to help site set-up and thus not involved with working for amazon and can not comment on the company
5,Work on computers all day doing returns over all it was a good job to work at. i learned that it was an easy job. the managment team was cool. the workplace was always clean. standing was the hard part for the first week. the people there is what i enjoy the most about the job.
5,Amazon was all around a fun place to work and the hours were perfect.
5,it was a fun and exciting place to work. the people was awesome and funny to work with. driving the forklifts was fun to drive and going 30 ft in the air was fun
5,they just want a body.
5,training:
5,"When I worked for Amazon, they were so unorganized and didn't have any people  skills.Being physically challenged, they didn't have the first clue about accommodating the physically challenged."
5,You cant easily transfer shifts or request days off. They make you use your time for everything. It doesnt matter if you have a note from the hospital saying you cant work or not.you have to use your time.
5,A typical day was waiting for the totes to come down the line with the items in them. I learned to keep thing to my self. The most of the management is friendly and some of them don't care about the people who work for them. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with the lack of work on the lines.The most enjoyable of the job is getting to see what kind of items people ordered.
5,As working as a Ada driver for Amazon I have learned that it is sometimes difficult to manage routes. Sometimes you would have to look in your itinerary to plan your routes accordingly for the time that you work.
5,"Excellent, the company knows your way and all the workers make alignment with the leaders. Full cooperation and work team."
5,I actually liked working at Amazon. I never worked in a warehouse before. I worked for them for three years but I transferred to a new fulfillment and it was robotic and that was my downfall. They terminated me for not making rate for the week. Management would not work with me or help in any way.
5,"I enjoyed working at Amazon and would work there again. I am rehire-able. When I worked for Amazon, it was a fast paced setting and in a large multi level warehouse."
5,I love working at Amazon!!!  The application and interview process was super easy.  My supervisors are approachable and easy to talk to.  I would  highly recommend Amazon to anyone!!!
5,"It's not a good company to work for, management would make your life miserable if your not one of they friends,  the will send you to unload trucks,  load trucks or to do anything that their friends dont wanna do."
5,"My experience at amazon was bad. I was the top shipper for 3 months, and it's great I was able to quit when I did. The pay is the only thing that will keep u motivated to have u come back. The hours are ridiculous and the management never truly want to help u wit anything. Music is trash and a constant distraction, while most employees are weird & immature like high school kids. Constant gossip wit low work ethics, not to mention the bad commute to get to work everyday. It may start off normal but u'll get tired of it rather quickly. If u need a quick come up then get on board, it's just not somewhere meant to be long term whether it's your discretion or getting fired for a petty reason. After quitting through a temp agency at a shift I didnt enjoy, I then returned seasonally through the company at a different shift, only to be turned away after a few days because I wasn't fully placed back into the system. It can get you back on your feet financially but it's only a matter of time before you're sick of it."
5,Work Sets You Free.
5,"Yes, Amazon has great benefits, that I can attest to, but Amazon’s culture is to discriminate against older workers. I have friends who work in other FC throughout the US and they attest to my statements. "
5,Amazon was a fun experience fair in the pay for what you worked fast past for a short time and relaxed afterwards good place to work definitely will want to work there again
5,"Good pay, great beinfits, I recommend people to work at Amazon if there use to being on there feet for long hours. You have to be on time and understand thats it's a fast paist job"
5,Liked the work i was doing.
5,The hardest part was working the overnight shift.
5,& The Work Was Easy- & days Went By Fast- Easy Money For Simple Work- I'm Ready TO go back TO work For Them!
5,Amazon is an amazing company to work for if i could go back i would! They treat the employees fairly and the pay is really good. You can advance in the conpany and that was always exciting.
5,"Amazon was a very fast paced enviornment, but also a very fun place to work. Requires alot of problem solve and inter-personal skills. Once you get promoted it involves more leadership skills and the ability to deal with Associate issues of all kind"
5,As for working with others it was the best job I've had outside of the military. However just way to much micro managing around the building. They are by far the best though about recognizing good work and awarding those accordingly
5,Before you get hired you can pick the hours and days you want to work it's a fast-paced job the pay is pretty good and you are pretty much Your Own Boss when you are on the road
5,"Could not stay busy, kids working there operating machines not fully trained to do so using them for reckless behavior while on drugs.  When brought to management took 3 discussions before removal of person. Process assistants believe they can treat employees like they are important and get away with it."
5,"Delivered packages for Christmas season. Was very inconsistent, a real mess to get straight answers. Not a place I would work again. Just all around bad experience."
5,Great place to work at. Fast paced and always learning new things. Perfect job for young people or first time job. Management is alway there and willing to work with you. Very independent job.
5,i love it great job you just have to motivate yourself to stand for 10 hours. the pay is good benefits are good also they also have good shift to choose from.
5,"I wanna come back, I only left because of the pay, but now they pay more and the benefits are better, I forgot to send the computer back (I was moving left it in storage) not eligible for rehire"
5,"I was a picker at the Amazon warehouse located in San Bernardino, CA. It was easy job but to overcrowd that you can barely get threw the aisles without bumping into someone or something."
5,"It all depends on your leader, your line of business and experience level.  In my case all but one of my leaders across 3 organizations were amazing!"
5,Loved Working For Amazon-
5,No benefits the job is pretty physical slot of walking and driving. Other than that the pay is basic and they offer no benefits the managment is OK and the job could be better
5,The insurance was decent and it’s cool that they give you your vacation time so quickly it was just the most boring job I’ve ever had. It wasn’t worth driving all the way there from where I lived at the time.
5,"The pay at Amazon is what got my attention. The starting rate is extremely high in comparison to many jobs in that area. However, you have to be a strong-minded individual to be able to work there for longer than a year or so. The work itself is very stressful due to the kind of contacts you receive and people you interact with."
5,They need to do more conversions. So there are more hired employees than temps. But the overall opportunity was a good one. It was a productive and fun work environment.
5,"Toughest place to succeed. As a leader you really need to exemplify all 14 Amazon Leadership principles to be successful. What I enjoyed most is you own your business, success and failures as an Amazon Leader."
5,"Where I worked at, I worked about 20-30 hours a week. They are improving management and there is advancement if you are interested in doing so. I did not advance because the hours did not caught my attention. Sometimes during the seasons, it is pretty slow for a time, but there are times that each day you come to work, it is busy and there is work to do. Sometimes a little stressful but you don't need to work too hard. The worst thing I would say is poor pallet building, but that is up to the individual to improve that skill. Great benefits, especially if you want to go to school."
5,"Amazon has great many great benefits. And I love what we do. All Inbound and Outbound positions are awesome! The leadership is very professional and friendly. I always have fun, work hard, and make history every single day. My fellow Amazonians are very nice and are always willing to help with anything. Overall, Amazon is a great place to be employed. "
5,Amazon is a fine place to work. I've been a manager with Amazon for some time now and it is a very fast paced environment that breeds learning opportunities.
5,Amazon is a very good company to work.
5,Great atmosphere. Great work environment. Love the management and the people. It was fun everyday that I was there. Management and Human Resources was very nice and listened if we had a problem.
5,"Its a good job to work for. Hours are great , Alot of overtime , Just stay to yourself because there is alot of people who like to talk. Its a happy Place to work for"
5,Really good love the job great people work there enjoy the enjoy the people there I recommend people to work at amazon great benefits great environment
5,They are a great company. We would stretch before each shift wrap everything down handle any products that were damaged and couldn't be shipped scanned the shipment before putting it on the truck used floor pallet jacks to haul stuff around Etc...
5,Work politics is the thing and exist in Amazon work place. always exciting and great experience working. always learn something new and excel from there.
5,Amazon is a fun respectful place to work. I highly recommend them for a place to work. Everyone is nice. Definitely a job worth waking up going too. And the pay is great
5,"Amazon is an easy job for the most part, just a lot of constant walking. I’m leaving soon due to the work environment, I started getting sick every time I went in due to the dust and dirty atmosphere and heat. I wouldn’t  know much about Management since I never had a single conversation with one that they initiated and they are barely able to be found after stand up meetings. I had to find a manager to address an issue only to find a manager to address an issue only to find out I had been doing my job incorrectly for months, no manager approached me about it or even tried to correct the problem. Not to mention you cant even go to the bathroom without stacking up TOT and getting in trouble. The only good part about working at Amazon is the co-workers/people you meet, I’ve definitely made lifelong friends."
5,Amazon was a very high pace job that requires a lot of physical labor in order to meet your numbers and to get customers orders out quickly for same day shipping and next day delivery.
5,At my location which is a sort center we will get in a truck and then split the load down the various lines where we will then load up the appropriate pallets with the boxes. Then at the end of the night we will wrap up those pallets and send them to the trucks for the correct cities that they need to go to.  It is fast paced and usually a fun team to work with
5,Great please to work if you don't mind that feeling of being in High School again.  The social/political side of everything and everyone there is what kills the energy levels while trying to do your job. Constantly distracted by everyone's social problems there.
5,I love working at amazon and fedex there’s no better place! If you ever wanna make good money and meet great people please apply quickly there’s very little room left!
5,I was a seasonal associate. Good job for college kids who don’t have bills to pay or people who don’t mind doing menial tasks. Good pay but very boring. I worked every day except Sunday doing 4 hour shifts which was pretty annoying but at least the shifts didn’t drag on.
5,"I would work here again, if they paid more to compensate for the long drive there. Day health care, Day one benefits, time off, breaks and lunches, competitions"
5,If you are okay with a warehouse setting then this is for you. Amazon is  very fast pace place. If you are unable to keep up they will let you go after while.
5,Productive and fast-paced environment with motivational managers. It required a sense of belonging and a competitive spirit. The staff was always helpful and available.
5,"This company is huge and doesn't know how to communicate! It takes sometimes weeks to get anything done as far as a conversation. If you hurt yourself they , tell you that you have to see workers comp and then push you aside."
5,"Exercise, grab scanner, go to requested location on job board, scan boxes , place boxes on proper pallets. learned more about scanners. the hardest part of job the job pace."
5,Good place to work if you are a hard worker. If you are lazy then this isn't the place. Good benefits. If you are married or in a relationship this may not be the place for you. if youre good at rejecting temptation then it can work you. There is so much temptation out there.  The women walk around wearing yoga pants or really short shorts with tank tops and they are very flirtatious.
5,Great employer who places the Customer Experience (CE) first and foremost.  Career advancement is most definitely available for those employees who put forth the effort and truly want to become part of a winning team.
5,"Great work life balance, room to grow, non stressful, free work out, Fair Leadership, Clean work environment, flexible shifts, at times it can be physically exhausting, important to stay hydrated, this job is like a free gym work out, could use utilize people more for coaching purposes"
5,Honestly working at Amazon yes was tiresome & daunting but I appreciate them so much. I took part in their career choice program while I worked for them & thanks to them they helped paid for some of my school. I will say that I worked at 2 locations. & My first building the overall encouragement & assistance from fellow co-workers was amazing the PA's at that location I felt knew more information than the area managers did which made doing our jobs slightly more difficult in case of problem & they definitely deserve a raise & HR was amazing. The location I transferred too because of proximity to my house was actually a mistake. My colleagues & HR at this location could be very rude but the area managers at this location were absolutely astounding & they made my job as a picker so much better. It's always hit or miss in general but for the most part Amazon really is a step up from most.
5,"I enjoyed my time there, but the commute was too long, especially considering the fact I was working another job. Its stressful to keep a high work rate. They will fire you if your rates are constantly too low for them (which makes it hard to go to the bathroom)."
5,I learned quite a lot of better ways of doing shipping and receiving that proves to be more productive and accurate. 
5,"It was good! Healthy working environment, knowledgeable management, and a great training program that helped me feel prepared to take on the tasks at hand."
5,Long hours not good pay flexibility and also room for career advancement such as education and employment advances within the company and others such as higher education within the company and outside
5,Management enforced team effort on each task I took part in and was very supportive through the entire process
5,Seasonal job that gave me warehouse experience overall not a bad job. Some heavy lifting here and there plus a lot of walking. usually just worked 5 days a week for only 5 hours since it was part time.
5,"The mission that drives this company is amazing, and it really unites everyone to work together as a team to provide the best services we can to the customers. The Leadership Team is completely in touch with the business. This is by far the most employee friendly company that I have worked in. Professional, hard working, top notch employees."
5,"There are 3 breaks throughout the day (two of which are paid), but DO NOT work on an empty stomach."
5,"Very fast pace during peak season, quota's where expected to be exceeded.  Enjoyed the family environment and we all worked together well. Lunch and breaks could've been longer."
5,Good opportunity to learn a skill and move on. At amazon a fair start is essential for your career success. The leadership principles guide the employee`s live stile.
5,"I am driving for Amazon temporarily until I find another position. I am only working four days a week, Friday thru Monday, 12:30 PM to 9:00 PM, but there is usually up to two hours Overtime. That shift doesn't leave much balanced time with family. The managers are great, but there is a huge disconnect with the schedulers in Seattle. Drivers have no input into actual conditions, and problems of our routes. After delivering during the Holiday Season in 2015, I see this a problem that will really make the job difficult and lead to problems."
5,I have been working for Amazon for a year I really on enjoy my job. I have been trained in several departments and learned a lot. If you let them know you want to be trained in a different area they will try there best to ser that you get trained.  I can say the only thing I don't like about my job is the uncomfortable cussing that goes on around me.
5,Its a nice place to work at I loved it nice people I had a good time made some good money the breaks were always on time I really appreciate it and everything
5,Lack of leadership
5,Lack of policy enforce
5,No communication
5,No real people skills
5,No vision
5,Amazon is a decent place to work. It's 50/50 like every other job in las vegas. It works for some people & others it can be too much or not enough. I don't want Amazon to be my career & that's why I am looking for a new job.
5,Great experience for anyone looking for help getting a job.. it's easy to catch on to the job titles and they are very helpful to make sure that you do what's needed
5,Only make you an ambassador & change your color of vest. 
5,the hardest part of the job is doing this particular role for eight hours a day 3x a week and have the week to recover from feet pain and sometimes back and arm pain - would like it if the hours were 4 hours a day and 5-6x a week
5,"Was entry level for 9 months, and after amazon increased its minimum wage to $15/hr, I can safely say that the work/life balance, compensation for work, expectations, and really everything expected of you is incredible. Problems arise the moment you accept more responsibility, however. The 'work like a robot' mentality starts to become overwhelming, and with hardly a pay raise to go with it. It wouldn't be such a glaring issue if those that did start to move up actually made a dollar amount more than entry level that was worth noting."
5,Amazon do have an great work ethic team . Amazon had helped me Grow as an individual. The job is very easy and very challenging but is definitely worth Your time .
5,"Amazon was a great environment for people to work, supervisor helps you a lot with anything that you need. I will recommended this job to any person that is willing to work in a great place."
5,"Great place to start working, especially If you are currently waiting for another position/job opportunity to open up at another company. Most of all the employees are super cool/helpful. Fun place to work, time goes by fast. So far no complaints, other than the fact that the base pay is 15/hour. Working in Central Valley versus East Bay, you will definitely be taking a pay cut, but that's expected. But the best thing about being employed with Amazon is that I'm stress free. "
5,I love working at Amazon it was a great experience it took me a lot.. around October Baby Daddy season so it gets very busy but it's great they celebrate the holidays they make sure you okay at all times they just great
5,If not for these issues stated above I believe Amazon could be a GREAT place to work.  The benefits are very good.  You get healthcare and 401k the day you start.  The pay is $15/hr to start which for the amount of money Amazon makes and the stressful atmosphere we endure the pay should be higher.   My coworkers are nice and I enjoy the comrodery and the management team seems to care. The problem is there are those quotas that HQ puts in place and everyone is expected to meet.
5,"Move one box at a time, And remember SAFETY meaning (YOU) come FIRST. No package is worth your safety."
5,"Was there for 3 years and tried to advance my career and was shot down all the time. They find small reasons to let you go, there is little to no heating/air conditioning, management is beyond terrible, if you are good at your job you are punished, they took away our stock bonuses, you couldn't even use the bathroom in fear of losing your job."
5,"A bizarre place to work.  Everyone is obsessed with and judged by being a certain ‘level’.  It’s not good enough to just do your job, you need to create something that makes the Amazon machine more efficient.  Then you rotate to a new job, and customers and co-workers are just left in the dust.  And then getting promoted is super political.  And your bosses my be practically children.  Everything is arbitrary, etc"
5,A block will be provided along with a planned route.
5,Amazon is fact paced. I like the fast paced work environment and the fact that I know what I am going to be doing everyday. The manangement is alright but that’s something I can deal with. Love working with people that believe in teamwork.
5,As long as you apply and get a date set and  passed the drug test and background check your hired so i highly suggest it to anyone who wants to work there and the pay is good
5,Did not enjoy working for Amazon. felt like a high school/Prison atmosphere. They do not care about their employees. i would not recommend them to anyone to work there
5,"Fast pace, fun, and friendly co-workers. Overtime I've built long lasting friendships with the Amazonians. There's always something new to learn and take with you."
5,"High energy and cheerful person, then this may be for you. No room for messing around! The pay is good but very little room for advancement. Fast Pace!"
5,I come in from 6pm to 6am. Make sure i wear comfortable clothes and tennis shoes. We do out stretches to make sure we stay fit and our bodies want lock up on us. I've learned how to maneuver my way around the job. The hardest place of the job is when you first start working and you have to climb 3 floors of stairs
5,I loved the job! When I made it and was being converted to beinga full time employ I was let go because I got my G.E.D online. Overall it's a great place to work the people are friendly and there's never really a dull moment.
5,"I totally enjoyed working for this company. Great experience , I actually wouldn’t mind going back. I just hated the mandatory overtime around the holidays"
5,I worked with Amazon for almost 2 years for the most part I enjoyed my job they trained me to drive a standup forklift a center rider an standby clamp  most of the management are to busy to help but there was some good ones to the hr team sucks though I am a single father an when I need resources an help to keep my job they seemed not to care so I ended up losing my job do to babysitting issues
5,"ICQA is the worst to work over night because it's boring and you cant even have conversation without people looking over your shoulder. also you have to walk a mile to get to the cafeteria or outside, so you had shorter breaks."
5,Opportunity to be moved around in functions which translated to gaining new experience in different areas of the warehouse. The way they train new operators on equipment is great for anyone unfamiliar with them.
5,"The benefits they offer are okay. As a part-timer, you don't qualify for medical insurance unless you work 30+ hours a week. With vision, you have to go to the participating doctor's office and state you work for Amazon and get a discount. How much depends on the doctor and the glasses/contacts"
5,The overall job experience was great it’s just really boring there was no action and it was hard to get schedule in cause they had so many workers I was looking for full time all they could offer was part time management sucked they didn’t know how to do there job
5,"Typically, I would log on in the morning and work until the work ran out. Eventually they would add more work and I would continue working. In between these times, I was able to play with my child, cook or eat, and do household work. It is a great way to earn a little bit of money while staying home."
5,"Unlike other FCs, this place is stingy when it comes to giving Amazon gift cards to its employees. If you work the nightshift chances are you'll never be offered a gift card. When they do it's only for the highest picker or stower. Management hoards those gift cards."
5,"Working for AmazonFresh is just okay. I was full-time for awhile until schedule changes made me change to part-time. If you are looking to make a few bucks a week then working part-time is a good option. As a part-time employee I am paid weekly, unlike my full-time counterparts who get paid biweekly. Part-timers don't get raises, so you will only get the standard $15/hour. The job isn't too stressful but working the fridge or the freezer section for long periods of time can be taxing if you're not use to it. Moving up here is almost impossible. There aren't many higher positions available and when there is the pay is only a dollar more than your current pay. And those positions are only meant for full-time employees. "
5,A typical day at work was going in having our group meetings with the team lead/ supervisor to amp us up to get ready for work. Plus our lunches were always nice to have so many people there to communicate with.
5,"A typical day at work was not complicated at all, but fun and competitive as you would always want to get your workload done before the day was over. You learn how to be efficient in prioritization and taking responsibility to solve issues on your own without supervision."
5,A very easy going job with day to day routes. One can decide its own hours and work when ever one wants. The staff is very helpful and the online support is always there to help you once on a route.
5,Amazon customer service has a great work environment with amazing people & opportunities. It is very easy to move up in the company once you’ve found what role you would like to take on.
5,"Amazon is a great company to work for, the environment is good an outstanding vibes such as the employees and manger that work there. It's a fast paced job."
5,"Can be a difficult job to have with the pace, quality of work and how much micromanagement there is to make sure goals and quality are accomplished.  On the positive side the checks are helpful and benefits are great."
5,drive all day on delivery packages really fun. Everyone was nice and polite.I would go back nice pay nice medical. hard part about this job is trucks are really bad on the snow.
5,Fast past every day learned I could work in warehouse at fast pace management friendly everybody is a team for the most part the hardest part of the job nothing all.
5,"Get this Amazon hires me, I do the training and all that then they have no schedule for me. This goes on for 3 weeks. Then they fire me for not working."
5,It's a cool place to work and it's very nice associatesthere is no human resources in the building but managers can help you out with anything you need
5,"Its good pay, but hard on your body in the fulfillment locations.   The fulfillment centers are enormous and you will be constantly walking,lifting, bending etc. The sorting centers are a bit easier.  If you are hired on as a regular worker not a temp. They give you benefits from day 1, paid time off, vacation,  and other discounts."
5,Lots to learn.
5,"much  favoritism, poor communication.."
5,Productive work place. Very challenging. Excellent atmosphere. Great place to get exercise activities in. Very diverse place to work. No one judges one another
5,The best relaxed yet fast paste jobs you will ever have. The consideration of warehouse employees throughout and before and ending of shifts there are work outs and stretch exercise that have you ready for the next segment of your shift. Great place to work. Time really flies.
5,the work environment can be messy at times but the people tend to be nice. the pay is decent and the benefits make the job worth working at least for the time being.
5,"This company is a very good company to work for. Management was very easy to talk to about anything.I was a good packer, I worked 10 hours a day from Sunday thru Wednesday."
5,we had to walk in swipe our id cards to get in than walk throught the gate. there was a section for our coats then we got patted down and we went straight to work after whatever your job was
5,"Working in the amazon warehouse was very fast paced and required a lot of physical work. Overall the job was easy and very to the point, I knew of my job everyday and we all had to work together as a team to meet the quota for the day.  The hardest part of the job is just getting use to lifting the heavy packages and standing on your feet for 8 hours, after that it's smooth sailing."
5,"A typical day at Amazon is every day. Clock in, attend stand up and get to work. As routine as it sounds is as routine as it is. I learned a great deal at Amazon, I learned: to set and accomplish goals, how to focus on the task in front of me regardless of the noise or bodies around me and last, but not least i learned it all. Jumping to new departments every chance I got helped me to understand the complete order of operations. There is a high turn over rate for management there at that facility, I'm sure there is just reason, maybe just above my pay grade. The workplace culture was a life all itself. Some weeks i spent more time with those people then i did with any of the people in my own house. The hardest part of the job was... well... I guess staying on top of you flex bucket and the best part of the job was the different schedule options."
5,always providing exceptional customer service to public when necessary
5,Amazon is a fun place to work because every day is an adventure. The management team is the coolest people around who allow you to be yourself and keep an open mind.
5,"Amazon is an amazing place to work. Working in the warehouse is fast paced but very easy. The co-workers are very friendly. Management is great as well. Everyone helps everyone. Very diverse. It’s a fun place to work overall. You won’t regret it. The hardest part of the job would have to be lifting heavy packages. You don’t get a lot but when you do they can be heavy. But, you can always count on someone to help you lift. A typical day at work is clock in, check the board for where you will be working, have a shift meeting, we always do joke of the day or fun fact, do our stretches and get started. Amazon offers free drinks during your shift (water or Gatorade). After everything is done, if there is time left in your shift you get the option to go home without it counting against you."
5,"Amazon was a great experience for me. They gave good benefits and paid their workers well, the interview process is like no other. The only thing thats tough was walking and standing for 12 hours but you'll get used to it after 2 weeks tops."
5,Depending on which department you work at expect to be on your feet till the end of your shift. You are always going to be busy. Based on work prefornce you can win cool thing such as a TV.
5,"Good hours to work, work is made fun, we had a lot of free food on our breaks.  It was difficult at times to be able to speak to management.  You knew what to expect, there was routine which made the work easy."
5,"Great work atmosphere. Beautiful campus with restaurant-like cafeteria, gym, dry clearner, clinic, bank, walking paths, security. Flexible hours. Frequent opportunities for community involvement and onsite learning. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming."
5,Guaranteed workout
5,"Health, dental, vision benefits are good from day one. Very High levels of physical labor and 10 hour shifts at the Fulfillment Center was a new experience for me."
5,"I got fired for something  I didn't  do and than they didn't  even show me the cameras  where they said I did this such thing, than told me I eligible  for rehire a year later than I went for it and than said  I wasn't eligible to work there AT ALL ANYMORE!!!!! Thier  racist  , always choosing their  picks. And this is for CAE3"
5,I liked working with amazon and more when you need a part time job or flexible job. Amazon is great for that. I really recommend it to anyone looking for a job that will work around your schedule
5,"I was able to get this job after having my first child. Amazon had flexible scheduling, & great helpful people as Managers. It was great working from home!!!"
5,"My work depends on my rates, a rate above 100% is acceptable. Below that you can get terminated. Diversity of culture is a huge hit for this company, the only problem is that no one takes the time to explain the different culrures costums."
5,The most stressful sales associate job i’ve ever had. Management had little care for decent scheduling. Expect extreme burnout and an ever worse culture expecting you to be a workaholics.
5,"There were a lot of lessons that I learned at Amazon, such as working with people from different backgrounds and cultures. I also enjoyed the work energy there."
5,This is the funnest job. i have ever had. Its relaxed and you can dress casual and confortable  You get the option to work whatever tine you want. I love it
5,"Well I was there I had lots of fun,sometimes the company would buy us gifts and,,, I think Amazon should have there own gym its a very big company.it was great well it last, I most say I had a great time wild I was there."
5,During the job some days would be worse than other however working as a team made us get the job done and that was the biggest accomplishments that we did when I work there and that was working as a team.
5,Easy warehouse job. If you do not mind the work then this is the job that you need to look at. The pay is great the work itself is easy and they are very accommodating.
5,First week is great.
5,"Good experience while working there. They were new to South Florida and the warehouse was very unorganized and everyday was a new rule, routine etc. The management is helpful but, lack skills. I never ran into any issues."
5,I enjoyed my time at Amazon it was a good work area the managers there are very understanding and try they hardest to work with every one to become successful
5,"It all depends on what your job is and where you work. They have pretty loose standards for lower end jobs. As long as you aren't high or drunk, you can get a job and keep it."
5,It was tough learning everything fresh if you have no idea what all of their abbreviations mean. Management tries to be hands on and the typical work day varies on what you do withing the company. If you only have to make a living then Amazon is perfect for you. But it's not a great fit if your in school.
5,Organize stocks and maintain inventory.
5,Organize warehouse space
5,The only issue I had with working from home with Amazon is adjusting to their time zone. They have a excellent benefits package and the job culture is awesome! I loved it but unfortunately I had find another job in my time zone so my life would flow smoothly. Once my kids are older and don't need so much of my attention I definitely plan to reapply!
5,This is a great job to earn extra money and exercise without even noticing it. 
5,"This was, hands down, the BEST job I ever had!!! The people were fantastic, the job was super easy, and of course the money was great!!! The only reason I'm not still there is that my numbers weren't good enough for them to keep me."
5,You work 10 hour days. 4 on 3 off.
5,Amazon was a great place to work! The pay was pretty low; however the benefits were great and I enjoyed my coworkers.I was exposed more to the shipping and receiving position of the job which kept me working hard and paying attention to learn more. The hours were very flexible so I didn't feel as if my time was consumed so much since I chose my work hours and days. The culture was great. I formed great friendships with the employees as well as the managers.
5,easy going and straight forward management style
5,hours too a little while to get used to 
5,In my time there most of management had no knowledge of how to run a department and relied on their PA's and in turn they relied on working the associates into the ground. Always made a fuss about making rate and how you should improve(they didn't pay more for higher packing/picking rates)
5,"It's been pretty good experience. The work culture challenges enough to build new skills, be on toes always, and grow as a professional. It helps you to develop professionally."
5,Mandatory overtime is very unreasonable. You have little time to take off. Can get fired for the pettiest reasons. No one truly cares about you as an associate.
5," out of college.  So, she never had to actually do the work that she critiques people on.  She doesn't know what it is like and how difficult it is.  I would have more respect for someone who had experience in the trenches."
5,Competition is intense.
5,"For warehouse work, they will hire anyone who passes a drug test.  They do not even ask for work history.  So, the majority of people hired are people who don't really care.  They also hire in bulk...meaning they hire a group of people and hope that some stay employed.  Example...there were 17 in my group.  One got up and left during the first day of training, three didn't return the next day, and after about a month and a half, it was just me and one other person left."
5,"Good environment & I like my job.  The pay is fair although not across the board.  I train new employees but get paid the same.  I did, however receive a $25 gift card for my efforts.   I love the flexibility.  I'm able to cancel a shift anytime as long as it is outside of a 24 hour window.  If I cancel within 24 hours of my shift, it will be a 'incident'.  It's hard to get fired from Amazon.  Have GREAT work ethics and you'll most likely enjoy your job like I do.  I've been here almost a year and plan to go nowhere."
5,The manager that I had...she was hired directly
5,"They have unrealistic productivity expectations.  At the time I worked there, they wanted people to stow 210 packages per hour.  They said it works out to scanning 4 items a minute.  Sounds easy. That is ONLY if you worked non-stop.  They do not factor in a bathroom break, refueling your forklift, waiting in line for a new batch of items to stow.  "
5,Very competitive work force.
5,"Working at Amazon, the other employees and managers were very friendly. Teamwork was key in being efficient at completing tasks. I worked outside pushing carts containing packages and directing traffic of vehicles.   A lot of physical labor because carts are heavy and the sun giving me a tan but they provide water and sunscreen stations. But for how much an hour I got paid, it was all worth it. My time there was cut short due to school because you are given a set schedule. They offer schedule changes but they can't modify it."
5,"Be prepared to work hard. The group of people I work with are great! If you need help all you have to do is ask. I just feel it’s a great job, I’m lucky to have awesome management and other employees that are higher up, or have more insight and experience than I do, but the key is asking."
5,I was just a software engineering intern but it was a great place to be. The people I worked with were great and very helpful. Most people really wanted to help me improve and learn more about software.
5,"I was treated very well. Managers were friendly. Very positive atmosphere. We exercised as a group before we began each shift. Each day you were trained to work different positions of the warehouse. Inbound, Outbound, Scanners, Pallet Wrappers, Pallet Movers, Big and Oversize Orders, Problem Solve, Gaylord. This helped you to learn the full production of the warehouse. I enjoyed working as a Pallet Wrapper, Pallet Mover and Problem Solve."
5,I work there currently and to be honest you'd expect better from one of the biggest companies in the world. They expect you to hit high numbers but they are not willing to pay high numbers I would stay there but to be honest I can't make a living of of that pay.
5,It was hard work but good pay great incentives and benefits. Holidays they show how much the appreciate you with catered meals and gift card incentives. It's a really fun place to work.
5,Mostly organized... Team environment. Warehouses automated. Most co-workers cool. Respectable salary. Great Benefits. Upper & mid-level management cool. Team Leads... Not so much.
5,Never a dull day. Always something to do. Continuous learning and advancement training. Problem solving skills are always put to the test. Such a big company has wonderful culture.
5,not much too say other then delivering 200 packages a day and stopping a 130+ times/ one of the worst jobs ive ever worked. horrible work conditions...
5,The correct information regarding Amazon's health benefits should be disseminated because the media has it that part-time staff gets health benefits but after speaking with the HR team it was confirmed that one must be full-time to enjoy such benefits.
5,"The management team has a lot to do so they hard to find and talk to, everyone is nice unless you make a mistake, they run a tight ship but if you can hold on it's worth it"
5,"The position was a learning moment and I appreciate everything that I have learned and I am able to use the skills I have learned, Amazon was great and would good back if need be."
5,"When you first come in you're hired with a lot of people. The object of this is to see if you really want to work and if you want that job then you have to put in what this company needs from you to work. You're going to be willing to be open to change. That's the key thing other than being able to get along with your other team members. There is going to be times when your other members are going to need you. This is where the team player comes in to help with your order. You see, it's the willingness that helps drive a great company to work for. And believe this, the companies management does recognize y'all first hand! "
5,"*If you have sick time and your going to be late especially while looking for a park, use your sick minutes/hours to cover that time."
5,"Environment: Very diverse which is great but on the other hand They hire ANYONE, they need to find another way to hire associates because half of the people make you scratch your head as to how they even got there. "
5,"Flex driver. Its pretty good, i can't complain. You select the blocks that you want to work, go to the flex site and pick up the packages and deliver them. Its simple and it pays well. I would recommend."
5,"Overall, it's a cool place to work, location is great, paid every Friday, the a-to-z hub app is really great and convenient , they provide water and Popsicles sometimes, the break room is very cool(they have games/ TV "
5,The Job Was Great I Just Need To Relocate. It Was A Nice Paced Job. The Managers & Workers We're Nice. I Always Was Ready To Come To Work When I Worked At The Amazon Warehouse.
5,"This was by far such a disappointing job.I knew it would be hard work,but what is expected and what is possible are totally almost unattainable.Expect to be criticized for everything you do and worked like a dog."
5,VTO/VET: They will VTO your shift and then have nobody there to cover the amount of work that has to get done so everyone ends up struggling. Or they will offer VET for your shift and then still have people not helping.
5,you learn everything from packaging to picking to stowing 
5,"- No set schedule. You sign up for shifts via their web app, and if you can't sign up right away you'll probably be S.O.L "
5,Amazon company is way to huge to not pay their employees enough. They want us to do hard labor and manage our personal lives but dont pay us enough to even manage our lives. They are favoritism in amazon and I think everyone should be treated equally. They have us like we in the army in this place. Everything is time time time. We get write ups for just time. Not a place for me.
5,Fast paste at work move fast stay busy and no one messes with you hgggghhhfgudidididididididisidididieisidusidididididjdififofkfofifofidididididididididiv
5,go in and get your scanner listen to PA tell you what to do and not to do so you don't get injured next log in to scanner and get ready to go pick items out of bin for customer orders
5,"Hours are only available during holiday season, as soon as that is done hours disapear and jobs are cut.  If work load is ligh for the day employees are sent home."
5,"I really enjoyed working for amazon, it is a great company. Easy face paced job, pay is decent. I would recommend a family member. Just the Managers get changed a lot."
5,"I worked from home. Long hours work on Thanksgiving and had to try and transfer people to different departments that were not clearly outlined in training. Training was long and poor. Also, mostly answered calls about returns and customers were very disappointed with the company. Upper management was unhelpful did not communicate at all."
5,Managers has no complete knowledge of what will happen to their crew
5,Top notch customer focus but relentless pursuit of innovation and drive for improvement. Challenging work environment.Large and complex organization with a very unique culture.
5,Always pros and cons to every job.
5,Can be challenging some days but can also be very fun.
5,For me Amazon is where anyone who expect be successful will want to work. The company roles and regulations really care about workers career and their future.
5,"great place to work; provides variation in work, options, opportunity; allows for school demands, certification opportunity outside and within the organization."
5,Great work environment fast pace to work enjoy it alot want to get things I didn’t know they had found out a lot of things that I didn’t know what amazon had o offer
5,"helped customer with anything that they need. I make sure to be ready and out the door so I can get to work at least 30 minutes before ‘start time.’ That way if there are delays such as traffic I’m still on time for any meetings or important tasks. I check voice mail and the calendar, then plan my sit down work time around other things like meetings. Sometimes it’s hard to balance between being friendly and keeping on task, but people understand that I don’t like to chit chat during the day – I like to work."
5,I am a flex associate and to be totally honest it’s not all that beneficial unless you are a set employee. All the benefits and stuff don’t really apply to you as a flex associate. I just began working there and I hope they offer opportunities to extend my time in the company.
5,"I enjoyed my time I worked at Amazon. It was a very organized working environment. I really had a good relationship with my bosses. Also, I liked the people I worked with. The reason I left amazon was because I joined the CT Army National Guard and I needed to get in shape for Basic Combat Training and Combat Medic Training. Now that I fully trained and go part-time to drills, I would gladly work for Amazon again."
5,"I felt like management, and the workforce were one team. Very laid-back atmosphere, but the task at hand was the main goal. I got to meet a lot of great individuals working for this company."
5,"I made friends along the way with working for amazon. The work is hard but it is work every penny. the hours i work are killer, i work from 4:45 to 11:15. the killer part is waking up at the early hours just to get work."
5,"I was hired as a full time warehouse worker, in Portland OR. Most of us worked 4 days a week, 10 hour shifts. The job itself was tolerable, if physically demanding. The quotas placed on employees were not. The stowers were expected to stow, on average, 1 item every 11 seconds. This involved bending, reaching, stopping, and climbing a ladder. After a couple months of working at the fulfillment center, it was obvious people were getting hurt on the job multiple times per week. To address this, they told us we would have to work 5 days a week, still at 10 hour shifts; to make up for lost work. This was mandatory overtime. It did mean  more money but obviously, people got hurt more. To address that, they decided it would now be 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week. I left shortly after."
5,It was a temporary job that fit perfect in my schedule. I am given a route each day I have my whole shift 1:30 pm- 10:00 pm to finish. So having a Sunday- Thursday schedule was prefect for me.
5,"The firm taught me to see my professional and personal life with a more well rounded and mature perspective. Challenging and insightful, you get what you put in."
5,Their website is very clear and to the point. Shopping is beyond easy for everyone. Very supportive atmosphere from my superiors and peers at work. I would definitely work there again
5,"There wasn’t guaranteed hours, you had to log onto amazon a to z and pick up shifts for the day or the week and if there wasn’t anything available you were outta luck. But the time that i dis work there it was very pleasant."
5,typical day at amazon fast pace environment everybody gets along good learned how to sort things in correct places no hard part of the job really enjoyed that everyone worked together as a team
5,"Very physical job with a lot of walking, lifting, pushing, pulling, squatting,  bending and standing."
5,Worked there for almost a year. Great place to be but they need to get rid of the lazy individuals who is wasting the company’s time by not doing anything. All and all I recommend this place.
5,Working in a warehouse that is two or football fields and management expects workers to accomplish daily productivity
5,"Fifth and definitely not the last annoying thing about this job were giving us routes that we were expected to finish in 20-30 mins. They wanted us to finish routes with 30 bags and 40 packages really fast for the delivery drivers. I understand that and all but then maybe you shouldn’t have drivers coming in 10-15 mins after we get our routes. Nor have 3-4 people in one small aisle grabbing packages. Once the drivers came, anything you brought to them they expected late. I have heard NUMEROUS drivers complaining about that but it’s not our fault if we get a new route and then bam 3 mins later the drivers come in. "
5,"Great environment, great energy, benefits, paid time off and unpaid time. During peek season you get a chance to win cool prizes including more paid time off."
5,"I had heard a lot about Amazon and my mother had worked there before I did. I enjoyed it a lot. It was fast paced and you were always moving around. I like to think of it as getting paid to work out because you are lifting, squatting, walking and going up and down steps constantly. It is very physically demanding but they always push for safety and taking breaks so you don't over work yourself."
5,"I have so much more to write but at the end of the day, Amazon was a just a mess and it was a constant mess everyday."
5,It was alot of people working there.It was hard work but pull through it all thank you.they didn't give us only one lunch break. We didn't get the two 15min break.witch we should have been giving
5,It's very rewarding to feel accomplished and knowing you've successfully instruct the new hires about the job procedure and giving them the tools to be successful in their duties.
5,"Its was a easy job to complete, pick, pack and ship packages for the company. As for the health and safety specialist for the company it was very straightforward and overall a good experience."
5,productive workplace. Fast pace well-developed company with good management. co-workers friendly. good pay and great health benefits. Higly motivated company to work for. Sorters are energic and independent workers motivated to work in a fast pace warehouse  fulfillment center for 12 hour shift.
5,"Simple getting in, get your task given right from the beginning. You have a 15 minute break that you don't have to clock out for and you get to play on the PS4 or just be on your phone while you eat something from their little store."
5,As you enter the  warehouse Can you clock in can you close the radio station and you have to work for two hours straight you can’t catch a break until the break starts it’s very physically demanding you have to be mentally ready to go to work.
5,"Great work from home job. Training is 6 weeks long. They send you the equipment to use, just have to provide the internet. There is always a manager around to help out if you have questions."
5,I liked the culture and team based flow of the warehouse. Managers seemed enthusiastic and other associates always had a positive vibe. The work was t hard and I felt great each morning
5,I love really working with that company . And it a nice opportunity to work at.i love the workers that’s there they is a really good team player with new and old people
5,Is the best but there lay off are horrible wait till late minutes always offer vto last minute anything never gives update wouldn’t be able to plan ahead
5,It is completely necessary to double time it through the day. The only things that really matter to management are safety and rate. If you work fast and follow every rule you will be fine.
5,Management at Amazon’s warehouse was very confusing and unprofessional in the well being of there employees. They lacked the ability to handle my medical situations and made excuses as to why. Information was always lost and I feel as they did no communicate enough with me about any part of my time with them.
5,"Management not too great but worked with some great people who made the job easier! Suppose to have employee review every 3 months to discuss performance,raises, etc. never had mine on time so be aware!"
5,"Position pays well with some benefits,  0pportunity for growth, Open door policy, Employee recogintion and rewards. Over time availabilty, Would recommend  it m for people  that need work expereince."
5,"Amazon job it can be very challenging, can be very hectic depends which facility you working, you have to work hard and always try to keep up your number, I love to work there because you don’t have to talk to any one about a day off, you just use your phone are computer to put in your hours and go. Amazon job is always you have to dive deep."
5,"Arrive on time, 2/3 hrs before you're on the road.  Management don't know what they're about. Start route late, GPS problems, Route problems, packaging problems, etc. Can improve w proper training for management & assistants. Amazon is all about the customer and zero about the employee."
5,Good job for people who are young and wish to create a career in the warehouse industry or those who seek strong benefits. Not good for people who take a lot of time off work or who become tired very easily.
5,Overall the pay was good and the benefits but they are very strict the work is back breaking and the manager I had cared more about the work getting done then the employees well being.
5,"Pay could be a little better than 15 a hour given the CEO is “The richest man alive.” There are pay incentives, however, they seem to be dying down and recently I’ve heard they will be completely extinct."
5,"The pay was limited, and overtime was offered in the ad for the position, but not offered during employment in the quantity advertised."
5,"The work itself isn't too bad but shifts vary between 3-5 hours, so you could work anywhere between 15-30 hours per week depending on how many shifts you have. $15/hour isn't enough to live on since the job is part time. Managers are easy to get along with if you do your job"
5,"Working as a Delivery Driver for Amazon is really busy, competitive, fast-paced, both hard and easy when working in the heat, best way to keep yourself motivated is listening to variety of music, or your favorite things that matter to you to get you through the day. "
5," I enjoy working for the company, I'll be staying with Amazon as a Delivery Driver because it's so much fun and my co-workers are what is a major factor in being in an environment that allows us to be positive we all now work as a unit helping each other when we enter the warehouse and when we're out on our routes delivering, our dispatchers are really good guys to get to know and be around. When we get done early dispatch sends us to help out one of our co-workers so they don't fall behind on there route, they also help us with any kinds of problems that we face every day on our routes or to our vehicles.  "
5,Amazon is famous for relentlessly extracting maximal efficiency/cost-savings from their suppliers and employees.  
5,"Amazon was an awesome place to work for and they value all of their principles. I enjoyed going to work everyday, and leaving I never really wanted to go."
5,"At Amazon, it is always a busy workday. You will always have something to do whether it be stacking, water spidering, truck unloading and other things."
5,"Great place to work if you enjoy a lot of walking. The work is not all hard in any way , the dress is casual. I would suggest comfortable sneakers and to switch them out."
5,hard work 
5,I liked it there but was seasonal and we worked from home so had a lot of computer work to learn and working in chat rooms to get questions answered and to speak.to supervisors
5,It’s difficult to get your desired shifts because all shifts tend to get closed the minute the shifts drop everyday.
5,No guaranteed shifts 
5,sucky hours
5,You would start the day by loading your van in a specific order. Check your itinerary to see where you will be delivering. From there it's just you and the dispatcher as you make your deliveries.
5,105F+ for weeks on end with only partial swamp cooler coverage.   
5,"Be prepared to work. If you can scan boxes for 4-5 hours straight this is the job for you. you'll get one '15 minute' break. The quotes are because they want you to finish your break at minute thirteen because they know it takes two minutes to get to and from the break site so really it's an eleven-minute break. So if you can take being cheated out of your one break a shift this job is for you. You'll also have managers but when I was there they called them 'ambassadors.' These guys walk up and down the site really fast to make you think they're working. In all fairness, I'm sure they have their own duties but it'll get under your skin after a while because they'll be telling what to do while looking busy. The regular associate is the hardest working person on the floor never forget that. Their benefits are good though."
5,"Fast paced, great place to work. I like that there is the option to get more hours once you are able to show that you are a reliable worker. I am also able to take time off when needed with no issues."
5,Fun place to work but they will let you go for no real pay reason. Pay is good but job security is poor. AM are nice LP will get you fired always watching.
5,"I lost all respect for Amazon when I found out how they hire. It's really easy to get fired too. You can get written up for pretty much anything. I'm getting married in October and they gave me a hard time about getting the time off I need. I was really sick my third week in. If you run out of time off, then you can't have time off. Makes sense right? Well, I thought I would be able to go home, with my fever of 102. No. They said I can go home but I'd be fired. Not my fault they didn't excuse my time like they said they would originally for my wedding, instead, they make me use all of it, now I have none left. Preplanned events don't seem to matter. They have their own agenda, management is all about themselves, and you'll just be another number. They claim to care about safety but it doesn't seem like it."
5,It was awesome i liked it alot i had fun it was easy work i loved the people i worked with the pay was incredible my bosses and fwllow employees made it a friendly. Enviornment
5,It was ok. Very busy .stressful at prime time and holidays. No follow up when had to leave on medical reasons out if my control.  They didn't care if u didn't like the jobs they made u do. I'm afraid of heights and they made me train for pickers that would go up close to ceilings. Causing me to have anxiety problems now.
5,"My review is good nice experience nice schedule nice hours wouldn’t mind working there again, only thing I didnt like was the short breaks and standing on your feet all day"
5,"This is a great place to work, but if you do need help with statistics they can fail at providing you with the proper tools to be successful. The co-workers were great."
5,Working with Amazon don't have to be completely fit but you must be able to lift packages of up to 75 lb. It is hot in the summertime it is warm in the winter. Amazon is time management or innate it there's no sitting there's no time wasted you do have the option to leave early if all work is done.
5,Also if any packages are un-deliverable instead of returning home after route you must return the packages to the facility.  This can take an extra hour because the locations are  generally on the out skirts of town.  
5,Good job and great opportunity to meet new people and different races like the hours and location and was a good job woyld work there agian if i was offered to
5,"I worked nights which was okay except after a while I felt like all I did was go to work, go home, sleep, and then do it all again. It eventually got to be too much and I had no social life. I enjoy the work it was fairly easy. I recommend it to anyone it just wasn't a good fit for me."
5,"I’ve been working for Amazon for almos 4 years. I have nothing wrong to say about it. It’s true that amazon is not for everyone, you have to work hard, but benefits and compensation are good."
5,overload on work. Managers dont care but them-self. that all i have to say about that place. I guess bad experiences working there. Richmond Amazon need serious help.
5,"Starting pay is good for a warehouse but you max out in 3 years if you stay in the same level (level 1,3,5,ect) employee so the only way you can continue to see raises is if you continue to try and get promotions."
5,"The job was fun, people were cool. Checks could’ve been better. Could’ve offered more incentives, and better break room things. But besides that it was cool."
5,Amazon is an ever-growing/-ever-changing company and will keep you on your toes so long as you like to be challenged. 
5,"Due to the flex up/down system Amazon has the amount of hours yoi can receive are somewhat unreliable. However, the work/life balance is great and you can basically pick a shift that works best for you"
5,I also have to monitor how much volume is going into each trailer to ensure that I am maximizing trailer utilization and saving cost wherever I can.
5,I didn't enjoy my time there mostly because i wanted to do other things and wasn't fully interested but even after it was really slow paced and boring.
5,"I got a lot of satisfaction by developing a product which millions of people currently use: Fire TV Stick. Learnt a lot by interacting with cross functional teams such as Product Design, Industrial Design, RF, Antenna, Power, Electrical, Software, Manufacturing etc. They provide RSUs but the vest heavily in the third and fourth year, so it takes a while to get them."
5,If the routes are well timed the job pays well and can be quite easy.
5,Tenet Concepts is the worst contracting company to work for though amazon they talk to you any kind of way schedule 4 work days might only work 2 sucks
5,The place is not good to work everybody knows if u want a paycheck and want to get treated like   apply there u won't last very long I was discriminated I seen racism
5,"Amazon is a great place to work for someone who is looking for something part time, full time, or even an seasonal position. I enjoy working here and having the opportunity to work in a fast paste enviornment."
5,Answered phones and solved customer issues. We had a chat room to interact w team members. We had access to supervisory help. If I couldn't solve an issue tere was someone who could.
5,Good company but hours can get very hard for social life and work environment. Skills are good and the interview was good and challenged you very good
5,Great job to have. Great work atmosphere. Fun. Good pay. Big campus. Very nice managers. Alot of time in a chair on computers and on the phone however. Free popcorn and coffee and tea. Alot of fun employee group activities.
5,Great Place to work although its very hard work but great pay. it will take up alot of your time but it's very worth though not to many places willing to give you what amazon will give you.
5,Great until it wasnt.  They need to do some evaluations on the company and they way they push for numbers. Which I get the more people order the more you work. But they need to understand we aren't their machines. When we break it takes us longer to get fixed than mechanical machines.
5,"I loved working here. A typical day on my job was moving carts, crash sorting, and sweeping. All of my managers were really nice and understanding. We also got a lot of VTO, so I was leaving every chance I got, but I would love to work there again."
5,"I’ve been with amazon for 11 years now. Amazon is amazing for the benefits, maternity, time off options and courses you can take to advance with amazon or to go elsewhere. My biggest issue I would say is the movement of management. The managers switch off (days to nights, vice versa OR to other departments) could be every 6 months to a year or if a manager leaves amazon. When you have a manager who sees something in you, it’s hard because they only are with you for a short amount of time before they get promoted or seek other opportunities. From my experiences, what makes people want to leave is first, the advancement opportunities. Lately there has been advancements in my building but that was a concern for most. Year after year many try to come up, but get “not inclined” for the positions they are seeking. Could be the person, but sometimes going through the interview process over and over can be discouraging.Second, repetitive work. There are times where you are doing the same job for quite sometime. So, if you do not like the job you are doing then people tend to get burned out and want to pursue other opportunities elsewhere."
5,If you like hard work and a sore body this is for you. The tasks are not difficult you just stand on your feet for over 10 hours and you are tired to the max after.
5,"Many of the workers are coming from uneducated, unskilled backgrounds"
5,People forget a job Is work. You don’t say I have to go to my job today. You say I have to work. If you have a good work ethic the job is easy. There is some ftustration with employees not being held accountable and HR does not support the Area Managers.
5,"There are some inconsistencies with management's expectations for workers and the message they share with associates concerning workload, safety, and operational matters.  Some of those expectations have not yet been adjusted to reflect the realities of making deliveries in this area.  This makes performing the job particularly difficult and produces a considerable amount of turnover.   "
5,"where they feel highly sensitive to any criticism of any type.  Some potentially very good people, but stymied by a company with no empathy.  "
5,"You do the job, then go home. If you don't do the job, they'll send you home their self."
5,"Good benifits, fun, have shift swap, if you like fast pace work this is the job for you. Offer pto ,upt, vacation time. They offer overtime, can be a little tiresome but overall can't beat the benifits they offer."
5,"I love Amazon and working at Amazon. Love the way everything revolves around customer. The customer obsession that I have seen with this company is phenomenal. Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. No dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome. Lots of variety and exciting work."
5,I love working here! There is room for advancement. This is a new building air conditioning what else can you ask for! The pay is great! Stock options and good benefits on Day 1.
5,"I really enjoyed working there and loved the management staff and the way they pump you up for your shift each morning. Unfortunately i suffered the death of my little brother, and then was victim of hit and run on way to work. Finally they didnt send my leave of absence paperwork to me in a timely manner (3 business days) like i was promised so once filled out and returned i was informed i was too late may return"
5,"I think it’s a pretty decent job as a warehouse worker. It’s clean and calm. The employees I was working with were nice, kind, and understandable. It’s really a nice place to work at. The breaks were long that was one of my favorite thing"
5,"Most managers are not a real manager, they just have done enough for the higher ups to notice them to allow them to get the positions. But, most of them dont have managerial skills such as they dony know how to speak to people, they dont have any compassion towards people, and they are lazy."
5,Really good company to work for.. Sanning packages unto the pallet to later be wrapped up and staged for pick up to be delivered.. Amazon is awesome.. Easy work with decent enough pay..
5,"The pay and hours are good. There is advancement of you want to work for it. I worked overnight. It was very fastpaced, busy but was definitely fun. Cool Place To Work."
5,"While working for Amazon I worked in 3 areas. Fresh, fulfillment, Prime Now. I enjoyed management and the environment. Very fast paced and challenging. A good way to keep in shape."
5,Working at Amazon you will meet friendly people. The managers always encourage everyone to work hard and to be safe. The benefits are great and competitive and the pay is great.
5,"$15/hour for a relatively easy job. There are around 7 tasks someone can do, most of them are easy. A couple of them demand a bit of physical activity."
5,able to work 40 hours or more.great to work.needs to improve the g.p.s  system.
5,Amazon was a fun place to work with a good compensation that’s why I like it a lot they respected people and also even if you work hard you know you will be pay as you work
5,"I loved working at Amazon. It was my first time to work in a warehouse and I fell in love with it! It is a fast paced job, but sometimes it had its slow days. I could wear whatever I wanted as long as I wore a vest. I love working at a fast pace because it keeps me busy and not bored! Time goes by fast working at Amazon!"
5,It was alright for the most part. Pay was ok benefits were nice. Management sucked for the moat part. HR was a nightmare. When i left they locked me out of my account so i couldnt fill out my paperwork in case i wanted to yo bavk
5,Modern day slavery. No room for advancement. It's not a company to work for if you don't have a college degree. Knowledge and work experience is not a benefit.
5,overall it is a very nice company to work for and i would recommend this to my friends
5,"Personally it was a humbling experience. I found myself welcoming feelings of discomfort, because in return I gained a new perspective towards self-discipline. I look forward to outlasting you, Peak Season."
5,"Place was great to work at. Great environment to work in. They were on a good time schedule, getting people out of the Warehouse and on the way to the routes"
5,Amazon was the best job I had so far.
5,Atmosphere is great. Willingness to help you and properly train you. You pick your shift. My biggest issue is that during the  application process there wasn't a shift available at the time. You have to keep checking back with them.
5,be mentally prepared to answer lots of customer call related to all situations. Must be very patient and a good listener. willing to show empathy at all times and think outside the box. be open to understanding customers and abusive ones as well.
5,Hard work but pays well. Overcrowded. Hard to make rate. Not enough breaks. Constantly pressured to increase productivity. Leadership does not seem to care
5,I would be so happy if I could work for them again I had such a great time although I barely knew ppl bc it was in Columbia South Carolina but it was great
5,It is a Very active job ! You’Ol  Need to be able to walk all your shift under weather conditions. Remember you have to work in a wearhouse where AC is not an option
5,Its awesome there if you are a quiet person and don't like talking. During work time there is no time to talk to anyone as you have a rate to keep up with. It's honestly not that bad a place to work at as long as you do the work.
5,"Shifts are 4 hours at a time, maximum of 5 and a minimum of 3. You will be able to choose between unloading trucks, wrapping pallets, scanning boxes, or moving pallets once you are taught these tasks. Breaks are 15 minutes."
5,"The job is stupid easy the schedule is nice. The personal time, unpaid time, and vacation time is one of the best out there. Just managment sucks and there is favoritism like I've never seen bef"
5,the most enjoyable job is when we accomplished a big numbers of packages that we fulfill that night and some incentives they awarded.
5,The people were nice the staff were very helpful & positive people. Very hard workers in understanding they help u with whatever u need they give u good benefits on your day one.
5,They are not professional at all they talk back to you they treat you like a slave they overwork you they don't care if you fall out and pass out there going to say go to the ER room sit down for 15-20 minutes back to the floor you go
5,good company to start working with and they are very flexible with your schedules if you have a legit proof that you will have to attend to certain important matters.
5,"It is a very stressful job, the policy of Amazone is ' Hire and produce the best'.They have a productivity roof that everybody should do or shall be terminated from work."
5,"Really good environment, fast-paced, management made sure before work that the proper training was conducted and a meeting to motivate employees was conducted."
5,The work eventually hurt the health of the employee and there will be a time he or she shall request ' voluntarily termination of  work
5,"• Stood in one place for extended periods of time, and walked a good distance around the facility."
5,"As a picker, you learned to pay attention to what you are doing. Management there to help you if you have trouble with your orders.      As a multi culture workplace everyone is friend an helpful.the hardest part of the job is it's fast pace. the most enjoyable part 4 days on 3 days off.  Thank you for reading my review. Have a good day!"
5,I enjoyed my time working for amazon iss. but it was only a seasonal position. so i left on good terms so that i would could come back again if i wanted to
5,"IT help desk technicians provide technical support and troubleshooting services to end-users who need assistance with their computer hardware or software. There are two chief types of help desk technician: In-house and Remote. Remote help desk technicians support technology customers via phone, online and occasionally on-site. In-house technicians only provide support for internal employees."
5,Loved the job but certain managers made the job difficult.  It wasn't the job itself but when i was hospitalized they didn't care. They were more concerned with clocking in than being well.
5,"Other than the pay, Amazon sucks they over work you, managers talk to you like you’re a child(if you let them),no job security, nothing but a bunch of lies, & favoritism. Overall if you’re looking for a career or long term position this is not the place."
5,This is a great environment to work for. Delivering good service and friendly environment. The boxes are heavy and the stand ups have great information.
5,Awesome staffing real good with balancing the choices between hours good techniques for getting started for work and preping for the shift to start. Would reconsider
5,Good place to work for most part just don’t get time off tasks and make sure you hit your numbers and you will not have a problem there and make sure you have time to take off work or they will let you go
5,"great awesome experience will do it again and will also refer others for the job . pay is great 11.75 or more depending on experience. learned how to work together as a team it built me to be team oriented ,nice environment very big warehouse."
5,"I enjoyed my time at Amazon due to the physicality of the work. However, the demand to make your scanning quota becomes a bit of an issue due to the amount of problem boxes, and labor sharing (switching jobs for the day). Also, HR does not handle employee requests and issues like they claim to do upon hiring."
5,"I really enjoyed working for Amazon when they opened in Oklahoma City.  This was prior to the pay raises for everybody but I left due to the low pay and hours (I worked overnight) but I would gladly go back now that the pay is where it should be.  It’s not like you hear about online, people work and talk with people around them. They get work done and still have a good time."
5,It was a great schedule I enjoyed workin there I was able to connect with different people. I loved that it was a fast paced work environment. I enjoyed the huddles that we had in the morning. the cafeteria was nice. I also won an Amazon gift card my first day there.
5,It was nice I loved it ! We worked hard and stood up for long periods of time . If that’s not something you’re interested in I wouldn’t recommend it .
5,My primary job was to sort packages and load delivery trucks. You did the job and went home. Nothing was difficult about it. It was more a physical job versus a mental one.
5,The company is great to work for and they teach you everything you need to know. I would recommend this job to anyone who needs a job with good benefits.
5,"The job is very hard on your body. But also extremely boring. The pay is horrible for the jobs that you will have to do. The management is horrible, most of the time you do not even know who your manager is. The mangers object is only to make there goals; they do not care about employees. You  are constantly being threaten with termination for every little mistake."
5,Amazon is a great place to learn new thing meet new people from different backgrounds and cultures and its a place to grow. The environment at amazon is amazing and the different acativites they are always having as well and the place just makes you feel like you at home and everyone is so nice as well the only thing i would was my con is sometimes it just gets stressful with the customers
5,"Everything was basically a regular day at work. Come in clock in, get to work until the first break. then take your break then back to work until lunchtime wasn't long but the day went by very fast."
5,Good environment for safety and working conditions.  Working for them was o but there was no way to move up in the company. The hours was short and there were no full time positions.
5,Great place to work with amazing growth opportunities. 
5,Great place to work. You get the ability to try jobs outside of your comfort zone. There is a great team environment.  SR. leadership support employees.
5,Hard work if you like to stand on feet multiple hours it’s a great company to work for hard work dedication pays goo with good benefits timely manner great place to work
5,I enjoyed working at Amazon. It was challenging in a good way and I got my exercise every day I worked. The supervisors are encouraging and helpful. They recognize when a employee does a good job and let them know. There are incentives to work extra shifts during peak season.
5,I worked from home and it was great. The breaks were short and the workload was heavy during the holiday season. The work environment was great and management was supportive.
5,I’ve worked at two different locations with Amazon. One thing that was the same at both sites was the management team. They both made coming to work enjoyable by showing genuine care and concern for the well-being of the associates. Games were used to help boost morale and productivity within the company which really made it a great place to work.
5,"It's a nice place to work at with great benefits, quick pace of work and plenty of overtime if you are looking for somewhere to work this is the place."
5,"Management is terribly disrespectful to associates.  Very unsafe at times.  Cooling system does not work, very hot environment.  Constant excuses and hypocrisy from management/supervisors.  Revolving door of associates, average duration of employment less than a year.  Promotion opportunities exist for loud, bossy African-American females."
5,"Mobile App Delivery job very well paid and flexible with schedule since you decide when you want to work, is a great opportunity as part a part time job."
5,Overall good place to work everything has pros and cons but job is what you make it they have so many ways you can voice your concerns and the people always have your back
5,The work is grueling and dirty. The corporate emphasis is almost entirely geared toward negative re-inforcement. Favouritism and cronyism play a major role in determining who advances .
5,Amazon is actually a great job. They have a lot of messy people. The feel like they can’t be touched because they are permanent. This is the one on Gold Pike in Fort Worth Texas.
5,"I asked my self, what leadership? The whole time I was there, everyone just read from their tablets. There was never a straight answer to a question as the computer in their hands won't let them tell the truth. It's like talking to a telemarketer with their flow chart."
5,I gave people work and open up boxes. I had to make sure nobody ran out of work. If our manger was gone we had to make sure the whole floor was full with work.
5,managers know how to make employees miserable and down right nuts. managers do no know how to manage employees. the company enjoys creating a rough work environment so they have turnover rate and the company does not have to pay high labor costs.
5,"My time at Amazon has been great. My schedule is flexible, which makes my lifestyle and work balance great. The people at Amazon are friendly and genuinely want you to reach your aspirations at Amazon or beyond."
5,The hardest thing is standing 10+ hours a day while doing your job.You are able to apply for different roles throughout the building in order to find the best fit for you.
5,The managers treated you as a number that had to be met or you would get verbal warning. I moved up in.departments and showed how valuable I was to most of the teams I worked with bnt some of the operation specialist/ internerns always set me up to see it how long it wouldt tell take me to fail no compiments or encouraging praise it made me feel horribnlr.a.d wor5hdess. worthlessly
5,"This is a great fun place to work, much more than I expected. They are innovative and also have programs to assist with career choices, such as college opportunities."
5,"If your looking for work to take care of your family or home, keep looking.  Amazon is all about the packages.  You work for amazon and feel like an outsider because of the DSPs.  Division in the work place.  Start work today gone soon as your 90 days are up that's when your benefits kick in. Eight days later you have no job.  You are not important, again it's about the packages.  I will not renew my prime."
5,"Managerial staff is a great, the company itself is very family oriented. Very relaxed work environment. They have a great sense in helping employees reach their best potential."

5,Analog Devices is a great place for entry level production applicants..
5,"I would definitely recommend this job to anyone looking for a fun, easy-going place to work."
5,"Engaged, motivated, intelligent team members. The culture is self-empowered, creative, energetic, and independent. Real sense of 'making an impact' on customers and markets. I continually feel like work matters and makes a global impact. Lots of opportunity for growth and diversity of responsibilities."
5,In a typical day at this job was satisfying.
5,The usual work schedule is 3/4 work week. 
5,Management was great.
5,Just an overall great company to work at.
5,I worked in various jobs during my time at ADI.  It was a great place to work.
5,The best part about working at Analog Devices was the exposure to the top analog designers in the world. Everyday at ADI was another chance to learn something new.
5,Best job I have had. I worked the front reception office and was busy all day with clients and helping the administrators in my building. I trained all new and temporary reception personel
5,"A lot of great, smart engineers who are open and willing to discuss problems that come up in your circuits.  Our group is all about power electronics."
5,Worked in production of  silicone wafers for electronic devices
5,Prepared the wafers for baking to infuse them with various chemicals that would render them to transmit electrical impulses.

5,"I learned a lot at Analog Devices, Inc."
5,Great company for engineers to work.
5,Annual technical seminars.
5,"a great learning environment, where everyone is learning and growing.."
5,"As you would expect from a billion dollar company, this is a great place to work. They treat their people well - men and women equally and respectfully. Once you get hired at ADI - expect to stay for your entire career."
5,"Being with the company for over 20 years, I have seen it go through numerous changes. Some good and some not so good. But, I wouldn't have stayed with a company if they didn't treat you with respect. They have a lot to offer people."
5,"Former employee- As far as companies, it is no different than others.. Same stresses and issues just different.. Engineering always has stresses associated with it.. Nature of the beast.. Semiconductor business is very competitive and time to market is always key and hence the stress. In the new technology realm, stress comes when product does not quite work as liked.  Leading edge technology has challenges, never been done before in most cases so need to invent and solve problems. That being said, once problems are solved it is very rewarding.. That is the nature of engineering. Those who love engineering are able to thrive and excel under stress.. Analog does have many lay offs, at the same time there are many people with many years in the company.. As for outsourcing, current model is to have everything manufactured oversees."
5,no good relationship between FTEs and contractors.
5,This is a job I truly miss and I am thankful for the opportunity that I was given!
5,Working for a company with a brand such as Apple and experience to match that brand made me want to stay forever.  
5,Apple is very much what you expect it to be. Fast paced environment which requires you to be alert and efficient yet the chill vibe of the employees makes it completely enjoyable!
5,Change management
5,Great constructive feedback
5,Love the culture
5,Needs better discounts
5,Understands work life balance
5,It is almost a cult.  Go in do your job leave.  There are opportunities to network but it definitely depends on your department and limitations.  The culture is like any other corporation.  You just have know someone that knows someone in order to get to the top.  If you're shy uyou will not survive the sharks.
5,"Fun and inviting. Meets people from different walks of life. Learn a lot of skills that can be applied anywhere in life, with or without Apple. Great experience"
5,"I'd recommend anyone with a strong personality and good charisma work to there. It's not for the faint of heart. The products sell themselves, be prepared for all types of customer interactions."
5,"Loved my team and we are all there dedicated to learn and assist while having fun, but there is no work life balance and hours are long with minimal breaks.You will work six 9 hour days in a row with one day off and then repeat."
5,Need to have more permanent staff for better quality work. Days are dragged on and work is very simple . Managers and leads are very understanding but temp agency on site seems to get in the way of work getting done . Agency needs to be walking on floor more to get rid of employees  that don’t work.
5,This is a wonderful job that can really pay the bills but understand that may come at a cost.
5,Too much of anything can be bad. This was my problem when working at Apple. My work life balance was awful due to the random scheduling and very very very demanding work. 
5,Working for Apple has been and honor for me. They are really oriented to make your working experience as an unforgettable one. 
5,Apple is really welcoming to making sure its employees follow their passions. In some cases those passions can become instrumental for the work place and you are encouraged to share and them among your team.
5,"Since 2012 Apple has changed, instead on focusing on the customer you have to meet deadlines on your assignments. If you work on the floor you will be micro manage by the managers."
5,This was one of the best positions I have ever held. I recommend Apple as an employer quite frequently. It is absolutely a company that I would go back to in the future if the right opportunity presented itself.
5,The benefits at Apple are great! One of the reasons why I work there til this day. I believe APPLE is a great company but the turn over rate is ridiculous
5,Very fun environment to work at 
5,"Apple has an incredible job culture and training program! They give you all of the tools you need to succeed in your position. A very positive work environment, geared towards bettering your own position as well as offering a ridiculous amount of ways to do so!"
5,Great place to work  great team and my manager is great and very knowledgeable  he is always available to help me with any issues and very understanding
5,"It is a retail job, without a doubt. That comes with retail hours, retail expectations, and retail customers. However, it is worth saying that Apple retail is far from your regular retail experience. One I would gladly take up again."
5,My advice would be to hold your own while you are there and really push yourself past comfort zones so that you can be successful. They reward hard work (well some stores do)
5,This was a fine place to work.  Loved the subsidized food and coffee/expressos.  Not a lot of cross over in departments.  People were very nice and helpful.
5,hostess had multiple jobs when short of staff but didnt get paid nothing more then a hostess even when other duties called
5,Hostess were working as servers when short of staff 
5,"It was great! As an Apple customer service agent I am tasked with going through a month long training course, graduating, from Apple in product and policy knowledge of all internal workings of the online and physical retail stores,  We were also tasked with creating a completely unique and delightful experience for each customer while at the same time, solving all of the customers current and future issues.  I definitely know the product and am excited to sell and talk about them with people each and every day."
5,Good place to work. Great Benefits. No guesswork with management. Always willing to help. Work from home equipment provided. Busy during or around product or software releases. Promoted quickly with more money provided for each product you learn about.
5,"Good work environment with good culture. Company has high standards, but is not stressful. People are expected mostly to manage their own workloads and to be self-starters."
5,"Great job, good people fun working experience, substantial pay,  just needed more hours. Overall it was an awesome learning experience with a lot of diversity"
5,I was lucky because Apple gave me lots of autonomy to do a better job than the person I replaced. It allowed me to develop better systems and automation.
5,Leadership at Apple is top notch. There isn’t a sense that being junior position doesn’t mean you don’t have a say. There is room for employees to grow if you take the Apple specialist course.
5,"Managing projects in a fast paced environment is usually an intense experience.  It is no different here.  However, the team and culture keeps you motivated."
5,"The job is great as far as pay and benefits but I work 11 hr shifts,  they do not have 8 hr shifts . They do offer advancements but it’s at their discretion."
5,Going through a third party call center company such as Convergys was not a good experience for me. They did really care for the employees. They were more concerned on getting their numbers up for the company tjam anything. I would work for Apple again just not through that company which has now been sold to Concentrix
5,Nice to work good people friendly people. good friendly working environment. a lot of diversity and different community people all working towards one common goal
5,Overall good.
5,Working for Apple is like reliving high school if you are in the popular crowd you advance if you aren’t you don’t advance simple as that. It doesn’t matter if you do an amazing job everyday and have amazing results. If you aren’t in the popular crowd you don’t get an opportunity to grow.
5,"It's Apple. Their reputation for having a fun, casual place to work isn't just talk. Open offices, relaxed environments, and fun among coworkers is the norm."
5,"Apple was a great place to work. The only reason that I could not continue to work there was because they needed me to work at night from home, and have a quite space with i could not do because of my kids"
5,This role is not for people who are afraid to interact. Not an easy job but worth all of the hard work. You'll meet a lot of nice individuals who share the same love for Apple just as you do.
5,"Typical call center, bad hours and hard metrics.  The facility is really nice and does have free coffee.  Their tier 2 agents were hard to work with and often push back.  The ding you on everything from not using bomgar enough to escalated calls and handle times."
5,"I worked as a contractor at Apple fresh out of college which was really great for me to get professional experience in a field that is directly related to my degree. Overall it was a pleasant experience. Work conditions were fine; it's just normal office work really. The most difficult part of the job was meeting the expectations of project managers in California. They had a difficult time in the beginning communicating their expectations so we had a difficult time meeting them, but after several meetings this was rectified. "
5,"I worked at Apple for 3 years, in AppleCare Training. It was competitive, political, and extremely siloed. A rough environment. I don't recommend it, even though it's Apple and it's cool."
5,I would have stayed at Apple but they only hire part-time to start. It is very difficult to get a full time position.
5,A typical day at work is sitting in front of a computer editing maps. It can get quite tedious but they allow you ample time for breaks.
5,"I believe Apple is a good company to work for. However, they do want fast turnover at Apple because as the company changes, they want the employees to change with it and it seems they don't help their longer employees the ability to change with it."
5,Apple has changed a lot since I was there. More corporate minded and has lost its way on the retail side. Services pushed over customer loyalty. Initially a great place to work.
5,Hardest part of the job is the stress surrounding performance metrics. Best part of the job is the health benefits and vacation/sick time.
5,The job is demanding and metrics are closely monitored. Schedules can be rough. The culture is great there though and Apple does have world-class benefits for their employees including on-site health services and gyms as well as a cafe. 
5,Apple is a great place culturally and socially to work.  They have a very hard hiring process and very few people get hired to work Apple retail.
5,"The work pace during busy times (back to school, holiday) are crazy especially in the retail world."
5,The best thing is you get to to work from home.
5,Very organized structure and good peer feedback.
5,"I work as a Genius on the retail side. I was able to progress to this role within 2 years, but it's all about the politics and opening positions. I love my job, great pay and benefits. You have to be great at problem solving and an amazing people person. We can teach you to troubleshoot, but not how to interact with people."
5,"Looking ahead, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee will hold its regular meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis-point,"
5,"Expected to work many hours to push product out the door, with benefits are comparable to other tech companies.  Also, the culture of debate can sometimes be off putting"
5,I am working with in this company and had a great time. You will learn so many new things and you work with different nationalities that is fantastic.
5,"I Really enjoyed my time with Mindlance (At Apple). This job was very repetitive, but also very rewarding. I helped create a better user experience for Apple music/TV/News users. "
5,I worked as a contractor for Apple via Apex Systems Inc. During my time on the Apple campus I was part of a small team designated for a new GIS coding project. Our team had plenty of autonomy for creative decision making and consensus building. I was impressed by the amount of trust Apples executives placed in our team.
5,"A great deal of micromanaging, as well as the never ending pressure to reach unattainable metrics. When I first starting working for Apple, it was my dream job. Sadly, things have changed. It seems that every week, there’s a new rule of some kind - but the “newer” rules don’t cancel out the older ones. The newer rules almost always conflict with the older rules and you have to follow both (if that makes any sense). Vendor sites are allowed to dump their work off on other groups, and nothing is EVER done about it. Only certain groups within Apple are held to the standard of “keeping the customer’s experience in mind” - so your entire shift is basically spent cleaning up everyone else’s mistakes/being yelled at and cussed  (by customers) for mistakes you didn’t make. Mistakes that can be easily avoided if the same standards were applied equally across the board. If you struggle with anxiety or PTSD, this job isn’t for you."
5,Company went with the decision to remove the bilingual department.
5,I absolutely love Apple and everything they stand for. This was an awesome place to work. Would definitely love to return Someday  still visit there quite frequently
5,It was an amazing experience. They offered great benefits and were always willing to help and guide you towards reaching and excelling your goals. Apple taught me how to interact with multiple types of personalities and skill levels to give great customer service. They were excellent at providing help in multiple areas of the job. It was always a positive attitude which made it very easy and comfortable to work and have a great experience.
5,Did not prefer work from home environment. I enjoyed working with majority of customers. I am a Microsoft certified professional and found it difficult to provide exceptional support with the knowledge of better products at a more affordable price.
5,"Excellent place to work.  Lots of opportunity, excellent place for advancement, tutor reimbursement, part time benefits, top notch training, merchandise discount"
5,"It was a fun experience, and provided a sense of family. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys serving other people, and craves for a sense of purpose."
5,"It was a great place to work with lots of fun people. I found every day engaging and equal parts challenging. I learned so much from working for apple, knowledge that I continued to use after."
5,They don't care about women. Diversity only matters when they need you to sell things to diverse consumers but the upper heads don't care about diversity or inclusivity. Management is always biased. Only 1 person running the HR department. Seriously horrible.
5,Culture is not receptive to 'outsiders' who have not spent their entire career at Apple. If you are expecting to be able to industry standard processes and terms you will be surprised.
5,Management at Apple really care about you as a individual and worker and makes sure that if there is anything u need they make sure u have the resources available to you and show you how to find them
5,"When you go to the first few days of training, all they talk about is how you don’t have a sales goal, we’re not supposed to push sales, and how they treat all their employees fairly. That is all false, sales are a big big part of the job and they want you to push every product and service however you don’t get commission at all. Managers will have their favorites and won’t care about anyone else. The atmosphere feels like you’re back in high school, a lot of drama and a lot of gossiping. I’ve had several things stolen from me by other coworker while on the job but the managers never cared. I was also sexually harassed several times by other coworkers."
5,"Apple was AMAZING!! Sometimes I wish I could go back but now that I have a child and childcare is so expensive, I can only afford to put him in daycare from 6am-6pm!! Maybe one day!!"
5,Very happy and lots of room for advancement within the company. Collaborative environment and a lot of focus on personal development. Always looking up!
5,I was brought on as a contractor and right off then bat this particular team makes you feel alienated and small. Compared to the companies I’ve worked for this one was just a depressing experience when I look back on it.
5,"half of the phone calls that you receive working in tech support here, are due to shoddy business practices and not telling the customer what they're signing up for when they purchase a phone at the"
5,I've been with Apple for over 4 years and it hasn't been the best work experience for me.
5,"They treat you very fair and pay you very well. however, at the end of the day, it's still Apple that you're working for. this is the company that only changed policies because of lawsuits. this company would still be making millions off the backs of Asian slave labor if it wasn't for lawsuits to prevent them from doing so."
5,"What I don't like about working there are the metrics. My managers have micro-managed all of my call times and times between calls and you feel very conformed to the standards of the work flow, unlike an office building where you can walk around for a few minutes and catch up with a friend. Its been very stressful trying to maintain metrics for me and it's honesty causing me to burn out from the job itself. "
5,"Your work schedule is based off how well you perform in your metrics. I usually meet most of my metrics, not necessarily exceeding them, and 9 times out of 10, I end up with a schedule the doesn't work well for my personal life. "
5,Apple can be a great place to work.  More often than not you get out of it what you put into it.  The best thing is the culture at Apple.  They truly accept everyone.  Huge supports of the LGBQT community.
5,"Apple's infrastructure group is broken down according to the applications supported.  As Infrastructure PM you have control of certain aspects of the project; working through schedules based on data center availability, freeze schedules and constrained resources made scheduling a difficult task; the PM could move the project along but the PM needed to stay focused on the activities and time table."
5,"I got a great experiences working with Apple Products, the environment was so friendly. was working comfortable. learnt new things, over all it was a good experiences."
5,"One of the best places I've ever worked. Plenty of room to advance, with a variety of schedules to choose from."
5,"This is the best at home job ever, I wish I was still there. The benefits were awesome. Working from home was amazing. You’ll love it. If I ever can get back in I’m staying"
5,"Working for Apple through AppleCare at home as senior advisor was a dream come true! If you show up on time, call out when necessary (up to 5 days a year) and plan days off (up to 10 days the first year) and keep your statistics good or leading with one fail or poor every three months you will not have to worry about job security. Because they work to perfect your weak areas."
5,Working with very talented designers made me a better designer. Made lifelong friends. Worked on some of the more interesting and impactful projects of my life.
5,"I have worked at Apple for more than 3 years, and I have enjoyed my experience. There is a lot of opportunity for career development and growth within the company, and management is very good at helping you along the way. There is constant self-guided training to keep you up-to-date on new procedures and issues and I never felt out of the loop. They make sure you are well-prepared."
5,Great job and experience. Lots of room for advancement. Definitely fast paced but your coworkers are awesome and everyone keeps each other going. You learn a lot
5,Me gustó mucho el trabajo aprendí mucho janitor 
5,Working for a company with a brand such as Apple and experience to match that brand made me want to stay forever.  
5,"Work was very fun, collaborating with other employees, team meetings, checking in with managers.  Helping customers and peers.  Very rewarding and felt good to know people can enjoy the technology to its full potential."
5,"Apple retail is an amazing experience-- if you plan to just be there part time while you pursue your real passion. The fact that they provide insurance benefits to workers under 40 hours is outstanding. I happened to work full time, and was quickly over the store's cheeky culture and fake management who are super scripted. Advancement is difficult for advanced people..."
5,Difficulty having two bosses to report to being Volt and Apple.  Metrics for performance were unusual and difficult to understand and achieve.  Great physical locations and equipment to do assigned tasks.  Great pace or work with accommodating breaks.  Offered good discounts on products and Volt offered competitive priced benefits to personally acquiring them.
5,the job was a fun place to work. they showed me alot turing my time there and i felt like i was apart of a real team. im very disappointed when i moved and had to leave the job.
5,"AppleCare was great, remote work is not for everyone but Apple is a great company to work for. I truly enjoyed my time in the AppleCare college program"
5,It is a great company to work for. Amazing benefits and wonderful values. It stands behind its employees and invest well in us. I’d recommend Apple for anyone who wants to work in a friendly growing company.
5,It was a great job but exhausting at times. And you have to work weekends and holidays. I had to work on Christmas day one year. Excellent benefits though.
5,"The retail stores are retail but unlike any retail you've most likely worked up until now. The noise level and pace can be quite intense at times. The location I work at employs roughly 100 people but management is a total of 6 managers and 2 lead helpers. This stretches management assistance thin which can be daunting in itself. Fighting crowds on the weekend can be a job all its own, let alone having to meet deadlines and staying ahead of the expectations, both customer-driven and systematic. At the end of the day, it always feels good to help the customer. We all have things we cherish and our devices tend to be the keeper of our memories, schedules, contact with the outside world, etc. It's nice to be there to help protect and retrieve those important things for someone else."
5,"Very friendly environment, helpful lead, easy task, always on time, learned lot of new products, apple is a very good company to build your career if I get hired again it's good for my career"
5,Apple provides you with the tools to be successful. Management is supportive and engaging. They provide a flexible work life balance and encourage team building.
5,At Apple I learned that a team experience is the best experience! Working together to come together with a solution to resolve an issue or simply discover something no one else had heard of yet made our job much more enjoyable. I also learned that feedback is incredibly insightful as to my own growth and successes!
5,"It was a great experience for learning new skills and getting into phone sales.  I achieved to be the 27th agent in the EMEIA (UK and Ireland GEO) department globally, however pay was very low."
5,"Job was great, the location is extremely busy so you are almost constantly in an interaction with a customer.  Company is great to work for overall, they really seem to care for the employees"
5,"Like all the millennials who like Apple products and prefer to use personally, I was excited to see how things are inside. I was expecting a nice and healthy work culture, and managers who think outside of the box. However, the reality couldn't be further from that. It seems Apple is stilIt was a fusty culture, where patronizing managers make employees feel small, worthless and disposable. I mean come on. How genius you should be to understand that it won't motive people to work better if you make them feel bad. Even the most cold, inhumane business book would tell you that it is not good for your success. Where these people get this confidence from? They look like they are hired to destroy Apple from inside."
5,"So if you like what you read, go ahead and work at Apple. If you don't, stay away. There are tons of start-ups where you can keep your self-respect while making money."
5,"What a great place to work. Everyone was always friendly and very laid back. I wish I didn't have to leave when I did. The work I performed could be very stressful, because at the time, there was not enough people performing support for the sales staff. But the extremely busy periods were very short lived, and followed by long stretches of slowness."
5,apples call center is a very productive face paced environment. working there for 6 years and 1 year in volt training for the company it has gotten more micromanaged and the work place morale has dropped severely.
5,"Working for Apple was an amazing experience, The only thing I had a hard time with was trying to get at least 40 hours a week. It’s nearly impossible to do that it’s a hassle to try and pick up hours from your coworkers. For trillion dollar company it’s not too much to expect a living wage. Unfortunately Apple has failed to grant that to its employees that are standing in front of the company, who are the actual face of the company, the people at the store."
5,Everything was great with one exception. You never know what kind of manager you will get placed with. They are not all equal. First year manager was awesome but he got promoted. 2nd - 5th year Manager could never really grasp my personality and learning style.
5,"I didn’t have any career before but they hired me. While I was there, I was really happy to work. Sometimes there’s lots of dramas going on tho."
5,Work is easy.
5,Apple is notorious for not giving their phone support employees opportunities to advance. If you are in the computer/application support side you can be an excellent advisor and still be a Tier 1 after 5 years
5,Good place to work.Lot  to learn. Slow due to lot of process in place. Need to be patient and know how to navigate the office politics . Otherwise things won't get done fast.
5,Loved all the co workers and team meetings!  Very diverse group but everyone was so friendly and helpful.  Advancement was always there just had to work for it.
5,"Working at Apple requires a lot of energy, patience, and effort. What definitely get what you put into it, but movement within the company is very competitive."
5,"Working at Apple means more than a job, but embracing a philosophy that taps into the mythology and stories history of the company. You'll be asked to go above and beyond because the the ultimate end result of the work you do is to enrich the lives of Apple's customers. For me, the best part of my experience at Apple was the feeling that you are part of something greater than yourself, and as Steve Jobs once put it, you were able to put your little dent in the universe."
5,"Provided customer service and tech solutions,and set appointments, sent artical as well as walk threw articals with some customers. Explaining steps or policy’s. For all apple products"
5,"Working here, compensation is good (not commission based so it's based on honesty and the customers can see whoever to make a purchase without feeling anchored to one person). "
5,"Good place to work but the work load is extremely high. The workload is why I ended up not accepting a permanent offer, you need to come to terms that you will never get ahead of the work load and just accept the high amount of work or projects you will receive."
5,Its a great job to work from home
5,"There’s a little bit of micromanaging, however for the most part you can pop in your earbuds and zone out while you work"
5,"When I think back of working at Apple, I learned the fundamental values of business while having fun. I was taught to provide feedback and give criticism where it was needed. I made long term friends and mentors. Some days it could be stressful, but that is the game of retail."
5,"Working at apple is really great depending on management. The culture at apple is really friendly and hard working. There are great benefits and it is a great environment to work in. Many of the managers at apple are not originally from the company therefore there is a lot of inconsistencies, unfairness and favoritism when it comes to advancing your role or promotions."
5,"As a specialist you would rotate between different areas of the store from day to day. Some days you answer the phone, sometimes your setting up devices, others your selling devices and accessories. You help a lot of people each day and you talk a lot each day. Management had their favorites and those were the people that got promoted. It was a culture of giving feedback which did not work out the well. People would over use the feedback to get back at you for a decision you made that they did not like. The hardest part of the job was dealing with coworkers, management and the customer. Customers were always upset about their devices not working and take it out on you. Coworkers were upset about how they were being treated and take that out on you as well. The best part about the job was the pay and benefits. The pay could have been better, but was okay."
5,"If you like to keep busy and are able to do the same thing repetitively without slacking off on your work, you will love it. It can get competitive if you want it to be."
5,Welcoming store that takes you in like a family. everyone is always happy; we all lean on each other to do the best of our job with a work smarter not harder attitude
5,"Great work place. excellent team members, great learning experience."
5,Love the culture and mission of Apple. The work I do is challenging and I feel valued for what I do. I am able to grow and develop every day in my role.
5,You are micromanaged down to the second and unfairly criticized for not meeting absurd goals across a varsities of products with hundreds of support articles to quote verbatim. Better buy in to the culture at Apple or you’ll quickly be recognized as an outcast and pushed out by management. They immediately pick favorites.
5,Not all the stores are trash but some are! If you want to transfer to another location good luck! They would rather fire you than to see you prosper somewhere else
5,Working at apple was a happy place for me. times could be stressful but apple has always provided a relaxed work atmosphere. i regret leaving apple due to family issues and another job position that did not work out for me. i would go back to apple if i had the chance to.
5,Apple has create culture and cares about they're employee's. apple has great benefits and great minded and good vibes employees at apple are really what make the experience they're all worth it.
5,Great enviyto work in 
5,I love the cohesion between employees.
5,"HOWEVER, this was my dream job/career BUT they NEVER give you hours, the schedule is rotating."
5,Cannot. speak to my experience than than to say that under the confines of a Non-Disclosure agreement I am no longer associated the Fruity Stand. I wish them all well .
5,"I had an amazing experience and met great people who taught me a lot about the work I needed to do, but also about being a better version of myself. I am truly grateful."
5,"workplace culture is diversified, but not necessarily unified. workflow is uneven throughout the year. colleagues are fun and possess diverse background."
5,Working at apple is always an adventure.  Everyday can bring new challenges and new introductions.  Training is always on going and it is an environment of continue feedback.  Tact and certainty in communication are always key.
5,I worked for Apple for about a year. In that time I only had one manager who was beyond supportive of me whenever i needed support. The role itself wasn't my favorite which is why i left. However the 25% discount as well as countless other discounts and perks were amazing. If you're looking for a company that will keep up with the trend of making sure the employees are living a life then Apple might be the place for you. The Insurance and employee Stock program are pretty epic as well.
5,Loved the pay and benefits! The level of customer service and training was excellent. Working at home can be challenging. Would work with them again but not at home.
5,Not a great experience with Applebees so would rather not rate them. If you have nothing nice to say its better to say nothing. The upper management set very poor examples for the new managers and the lack of training was another issue i had a huge problem with.
5,Working for this company help me grow hellp me become and great team player and work well with other help me grow as a person  and for that thank you .
5,You will meet amazing people that will teach you a lot about life and how amazing people can be! 
5,apple has a great culture with a positive work life balance. Any of the positions at Apple have a fun and energetic feeling that is welcoming for anyone to work there.
5,Management was great and awesome workplace culture. A typical day at work includes working with customers to solve their iOS related issues. The most enjoyable part about the job was working with people.
5,Management seem to be pressured on time deadlines which in-turn put  pressure on employee's to work without bathroom or water breaks on occasion.
5,With so much opportunity to foster and environment of creativity and intellctual expansion this branch of Apple Inc. falls dramatically short on employee support and engagement.
5,"Working with customers at Apple was pretty fantastic. However, the management and employees are so narcissistic and cliquey that it becomes difficult to really enjoy work if you're not part of the 'in' crowd. Not being part of this crowd precludes you from advancing in the company, which is not okay. Also, working in a supervisory role made it extremely difficult to ever turn off your brain after work. I felt like I never truly clocked out in 3 years."
5,Good benefits
5,"Good experience and I learned enough to help others along the way, which was definitely encouraged."
5,I learned the value of positive feedback. Apple is a company where I feel like I can grow without fearing the consequences of making simple mistakes. There is always someone to help me when I need it the most. I enjoy meeting new people and being able to help them with whatever they need.
5,"Management was terrible, results didn't matter for upward mobility nearly as much as being a yes man."
5,"Tiger OSX 10.4 was launched when I began with Apple, they had parties and vendor fairs, tons of free swag.  The products that Apple offered at that time surpassed everything else in the market. Steve Jobs was at the helm and it was fun place to be. When the iPhone came out, everyone in the company got one for free."
5,"Work-Life balance is something they preach about yet expect you to put them as #1 priority, working holidays, weird hours etc."
5,"As a Technical Specialist, my duties were mostly limited to the Genius Bar. This is a difficult role, one that requires immense levels of empathy and compassion. During my two and a half years there, I made it clear that while I enjoyed the work I was doing, I was interested in moving to a role that would play to more of my strengths, so that I could continue being an asset to the company rather than feel like my talents were wasted."
5,I enjoyed working there and would work there again.
5,"Its as good as it gets for a retail job. This by no means so be anyones career choice, the benefits and pay are good for working in the mall, but you must work most weekends. you have to plan any out of work activities a month or more in advance to get the time off. Your hours will vary greatly every day, its exhausting telling customers the same things every single day."
5,The cafeteria was great and they let me bring my scooter to work.
5,If you work in the call center. You will need to network and prove that you can handle the new tasks as well as your current tasks. The perks are good. But you need to be mindful of your growth and actively engage on how to advance in the company.
5,Training is exceptional to learn how to deal with different client emotions and technical backgrounds. Even though I worked from home the feel of having your team with you is always there.
5,I just wished they worked a lot more with there employees I set myself up trying to help them out which in the end hurt my points and caused me to get fired later on
5,productive work place but not that work life balanced place. Expectation is very high. Could be using lot of latest technologies and tools to develop the application.
5,It was an amazing place to work. The people are amazing and the customers are so reliant on you. The internal environment is one that cannot be duplicated.
5,"Positives: Products worked very well- few technical snafu to deal with, very good health benefits. Compensation was average for the tech industry. The stock performance partially made up for lower overall salary/commission compensation than smaller tech firms."
5,"A typical day is fast-paced, unpredictable, and sharpens your mind. The people have a lot of self-drive, are willing to help, and are more like you than you think."
5,Working for Apple was amazing. Experiences in store will always depend on the management but most managers are truly there to support you. 
5,Awesome company to work for very flexible schedule new projects all the time friendly co worker and manager excellent training lots of responsibilities and duties to the customers.
5,"I never woke up dreading the day ahead of me while at apple, I always looked forward to my shifts. The people are all outgoing and friendly and the management are flexible and supportive"
5,"It's easy to do the job well and maintain high metrics, but its a thankless job and you're always going to be criticized before you'll be praised. At the end of the day, it's a job that you have to absolutely love in order to prevent burnout. However, with only 7 seconds between calls for iOS employees, it's pretty difficult to keep it together sometimes. "
5,I would never work for Apple through Volt again. They are the worst & they don’t care about their employees. They all racist and if you are not from their particular background they will lie and spy on you to get you fired.
5,Benefits were amazing.
5,"I was an At Home Advisor. Able to work from home, shift changes occurred every 3-6 months, but hours/shifts could be traded if you did not get something that worked for you."
5,The client Apple started my career choice of customer service as a notch in my belt.
5,"Apple has a fantastic Culture, but location plays an essential role. Management is terribly sourced for the most part. Advancement is limited in large locations. A day is basically a standstill until customers need assistance. The most enjoyable part is usually the people you will work with, makes friends, because they will help time fly at work."
5,"Salem NH Apple store management needs to get thier head out of each others bungholes.  Part time position I interviewed with 4 different layers of management, team leader, store manager, district manager, regional manager over 3 weeks time all separate interviews.  You think they could be more efficient and have one group meeting.  Can you say top heavy management, must be justification for the management group to protect their salaries.  What the store needs to continue to invest in staff that truly works with the customers.  The term Genius should not be used at this store."
5,The client Apple helped me transition my mind for technical support and to pursue it even while working an occupation that is not technical support.
5,"Nothing bad to say, only here because I am required.  Not sure why they want me to review them, it's a great place to work. they bring beer trucks on to campus, management is cool."
5,"Fast paced, focussed and collaborative environment. Easy to move across groups but up to certain level. Being subject matter expert is important and appreciated for career advancement."
5,"great company, super fast paced, a lot to learn. Apple gave me a chance being 18 years old as a self made entrepreneur repairing and replacing apple devices myself at a young age. They hired me on the flip of a coin put me in a tech role, and within 6 months explore my sales side to only better me by positioning my title as a business expert. Because of my ability to patiently focus on one person at a time individually but collaboratively & simultaneously work in a group they moved me up so soon. I left to marry my newly wed tech skills and drive for learning to the Code and developer side and become a Full Stack Web developer. Thanks Apple for helping me explore my passion."
5,"Benefits package as a part-timer was unparalleled. Not a career for everyone because the hours, while top of the line for retail, is still a retail schedule, but my managers were always respectful of my breaks and well-being."
5,"Highly recommend for the experience. Pay is better than all other non-sales retail positions I’ve had, but still leaves something to be desired in entry-level."
5,Try and find parking buzz in out my stuff in the locker wipe down my station clock in  log in to the phones and start taking calls help customers one by one might take a bathroom break or a snack then get back on the ones for a couple more hours then lunch that’s 45 minutes the log back in take calls till it’s time to clock out
5,Great company with good compensation  the Austin campus had limited opportunities for advancement and doing different things it seemed. Management and teams were skilled
5,"I worked for an outsourced company of Apple Called Concetrix. The only good thing I can say about the company is the training to start the job is extensive and semi beneficial. The management was horrible, the job security was nonexistent, there was no room for improvement and the turnover was astronomical. I would only recommend applying for this company as a temporary job to make ends meet until something better comes along."
5,"Por el trabajo que haces el pago es malisimo. Vacaciones deficil de tener. Caso nunca te lo dan cuando lo quieres, tampoco hay semanas juntas. Todos son 'selfcreated ídolos' y no saben que hacen, sobre todo la conversación entre ellos no funciona.  Apple en España esta representado por Sellbytel or últimamente llamado Zelda en Barcelona. NO LO RECOMENDÓ A MI PEOR ENIMIGO!!!!"
5,"Work environment was ok always over time available. The supervisors were nice, management was always open and available if you and a issues and were good with resolving you issues"
5,As a company apple is not afraid to take risks and explore new ideas. The partnership between design and engineering is what makes the company's products special.
5,"I learned an immense amount about being an adult with a 'real' job during my six years at Apple.  The culture was incredible, the opportunities to learn every aspect of the retail business were readily available, and the benefits are unparalleled (even for part-time workers) in the retail world.  Depending on the store leader, it was fairly easy to have a schedule that worked around your life despite the business requirements of covering 12-14 operating hours, seven days per week."
5,Making yourself better including the people around.
5,Your development depends on you and the work you put in.
5,Awesome place to grow and promote. I have learned a lot and resolved almost impossible issues while I was dealing with server's troubleshooting and networking issue.
5,"Being able to receive and give feedback, collaborating with others, and practicing open communication is key to being a successful employee at Apple. The employee benefits are great and this is one of the biggest reasons why people stay... (discounts, dental, vision, health, 401k, Apple stocks, etc.)"
5,The only downside to working at Apple as a Specialist are the long hours. It is a retail environment so your schedule will be different every week and they will need you on the weekends. 
5,"This job does have its challenges but, you will work in a supportive environment where your colleagues will try their best to help as long as you are open to it. There is always room for improvement for the Specialists as well as the Senior Managers. "
5,"You must be interpersonal savvy, empathetic, passionate, and a team player. Having a technology background does not guarantee you a spot at an Apple Store. Like any other job, do not underestimate the interview process."
5,It was a wonderful retail job. They give you a lot of benefits as a part time worker. The hardest part is working with a lot of customers and it get hectic sometimes.
5,learned how to rebuild and refurbish apple products. it was a private seller i worked for not the actual Apple company. but i worked for about 5 hours a day
5,"Very flat organization without much room for advancement. Your experience can vary greatly depending on your manager.  On the positive side, everyone is very smart, the work is compelling, and it’s an exciting environment. The pace can be frenetic at times, which can be both exciting and challenging."
5,good at coding and good at communication
5,There is a variety of communication tools to help people stay connected
5,This company does not follow its mission. They are in the top 3 worse companies I have ever worked with. Management HR is horrible. If you want job security go elsewhere
5,"Welcome to the website. If you're here, you're likely looking to find random words. Random Word Generator is the perfect tool to help you do this. While this tool isn't a word creator, it is a word generator that will generate random words for a variety of activities or uses. Even better, it allows you to adjust the parameters of the random words to best fit your needs."
5,"This tool can be useful for games like Pictionary or MadLibs. Since the words are random, this helps to keep a game like Pictionary fair for all those playing. For a game like MadLibs, it can help kids improve"
5, their vocabulary by generating words they may not have ever considered to fill in the blank spaces. The tool has the potential to help with any word game that doesn't require a specific word.
5,"Apple has many benefits and perks, such as stock, product discounts, full pay for bereavement, jury duty, etc. There is a very positive and inclusive culture at Apple. This is a company that some may find appealing enough to make into a career."
5,a wonderful company to work for and knows how to take care of employees once moved out of retail sector. The hardest part of the position is work life balance as well as returning to pursue higher education. Not as flexible with school scheduled as you move up in positions
5,I didn't really work for Apple. I worked for a temp company that staffed for Apple. The job was not intellectually or physically taxing. I just rode around in a car all day while the LIDARS did the work.
5,"I was in a remote position at home; therefore, the flexibility that the job provided complemented my busy life is a student and an athlete. I was given paid time off, sick time, and the option for healthcare benefits despite only being on a part-time schedule. Beyond that, Apple offered tuition reimbursement for classes each semester, which was extremely helpful towards future financial needs. Finally, the extensive training and support offered by Apple is something that has lasted with me through each job after that."
5,This is not your normal retail job. You feel like family when you are working their There is work life balance with in this company. The benefits our great for full timers and as well as part-timers.
5,I worked as a student AppleCare Advisor and it was great! You can work from home via the iMac that's provided to you. Everyone is very eager to help you learn about new issues as well as the exciting new technology coming out.
5,"The environment at Apple is structured and scheduled. The people and other employees are kind, welcoming and professional, and the employers treat them with respect."
5,collaborative culture and sense of ownership. Supportive manager styles to growth your career. 
5,Great place to work! Full of excellent people who support each other. Very good place to build customer service and interpersonal skills. Management was also great too. Management was always available when needed.
5,I have an amazing time and they are really great when it comes to having people grow. This is a great team to work with. I really enjoy this job and the people are amazing.
5,Look always feedback from peers and managers to move on
5,"Working at retail is just that - retail. Apple has exceptional benefits, but I would not weigh it against other retail places I have worked, since the politics are all the same."
5,"I worked there 7 months before resigning. It was dark with no windows, and made you feel like you were going mad. The management was only there half the days you were and managed too many people to care about you or your commitment to the company. You are just a number to them. Between the customers screaming at you for their broken phone, the family of a lost loved one trying to retrieve information you couldn’t provide, and the nonstop queue that never gave you a moment to breathe, I can accurately say it was a nightmare."
5,"As time went on, micromanagement became the biggest pet peeve in being there. Having to meet the 'business' side of standards, along with certain speed expectations that are only a 'requirement' because of minimizing resources of people and using every moment to occupy floor space when there is free time in the little free time employees get. "
5,"I worked there for 3 years and a little change. The job is pretty basic with high expectations, but surprisingly easy to meet the standards with minimal effort."
5,People come first. Positive Intent. Work life balance. Creative. Innovative. Downloads. Amazing team. Great Benefits. Training. Communication. Opportunity for growth.
5,"The culture in apple, however, is what keeps you in. The people, not the customers, become family and welcome you with open arms for teaching and help. The stock options, benefits, and schedule freedom (for part timers) become worth it in the long run."
5,"Compare to other F.A.N.G companies, Apple is very work related friendly to employees. There is no cut throat competition nor fire people because they could not be the best. But the lower level management is bad. Because they are so afraid to fire people, the promotion is mostly based on friendship and pulling the strings. If you could stay with Apple for 10+ , you can get to different place different level even though you have no education nor continuous education for that duty."
5,"I contracted with Apple and was extremely satisfied with the experience.  Most of the employees are super easy to get along with, highly educated and amply professional.  The cafeteria is like eating at a restaurant.  Apple is a great place to work because it allows one to blossom in their own way without any stifling at all."
5,"I love Apple and have been using their products since the iPod Shuffle came out. Even though I left my job with Apple, I still highly recommend their products because of the simplicity of them and the quality. I left mainly because my manager was not helpful and my schedule was never flexible even though they said they would accommodate me since I was a full time student."
5,"Apple has a unique way of showing their employees care. Apple goes above and beyond to help their employees have a fulfilling work and home life. Great management, motivating culture, and a knack for keeping its employees happy and content!"
5,I learn lots of skills it was very nice and friendly environment and i really enjoy from my work specially at the team working with specialized people.
5,"I learned through my experience at Apple that it's best to make a customer feel comfortable first; my perspective is that this made the encounter feel less like a transaction and more of a conversation with a friend. I learned that no matter how much you think you deserve a promotion and/or acknowledgment, sometimes you will be overlooked, and that the circumstance should be viewed as an opportunity for improvement instead of something negative. "
5,"The hardest part of the job, to me, was helping some of the newer employees understand that even though our atmosphere was light and fun, there was a still business that needed to be maintained. The family vibe encouraged within the store would often lead to more complacent and/or relaxed behaviors on the floor."
5,"Working at Apple was a great experience for me, a typical day meant communicating with a lot of customers for a range of reasons; whether it's interest in a product or someone just curious about the store and wanting to learn more. "
5,"Apple has a particular way to work and expect you get the unwritten rules of work.  If you have a different way to work or don't get the Apple way right away, not a pleasant experience.  But for those who get it or are on a supportive team it is a great place to work."
5,Good lunch in a good environment.  Very professional supervisors.  25 Cents vending machine.  But we got moved around a lot to different offices.  4 times within a year.
5,"Great benefits, great culture"
5,Great bonuses and great advancement opportunities 
5,"Overall, I had a very pleasurable experience at Apple and really loved how no matter the situation, you knew there was always a team member you could depend on if assistance was required. It truly was a team environment."
5,"They may work you a ton of hours though even as a part-timer, so it becomes hard to schedule your part time schedule with school/other things."
5,Great work life balance and if you are part of the college program they work around your school schedule
5,"Fast pace moving environment. Collaborating with peers and vendors to provide support. Managing schedules, priorities to meet strict time lines and rollouts."
5,Great place to work. They have great perks for employees and family. Excellent cafe. Easygoing environment and employees. I learned a lot working at Apple. Two thumbs up!
5,Kind of inside joke how we are not trained.
5,They need to allocate morr training to Technical Specialists 
5,Difficult to obtain Full Time
5,Great benefits
5,Great Company 
5,"Great training, team, culture, tools, people, product, and service!"
5,Retail schedule 
5,Apple is a good task doer place to be. If someone likes to be a creature of habit. Apple retail is the place to be that of which will take you if you also have a very drawing positive personality
5,"Great people and lots to see and do.Time management is one of the hardest parts while still maintaining a 100% customer focus. The environment can get a little overwhelming at times with how busy it can get, but there is always someone that will help you decompress."
5,Had so many opportunities to learn from such an honored company. Grew as an editor and as a team player while gaining knowledge everyday I came in. Wish I could go back.
5,"Learned tech support, how to create business processes, senior-management presentation skills, leadership, professional communication, and many more skills."
5,It is what you make it. There are times where its great. unfortunately the culture has change from being a company about its employees and customers to now focusing on the sale sale sale.
5,"I've been involved in network design, documentation and implementation most of my career. Indeed, those three qualities were how the job roll was explained when I first accepted the offer from Apple. The first year felt right and I was challenged in all the right ways. I also had a sense that my work was providing value to Apple."
5,"In spring of the following year year, due to managerial reorganization, I was put into a roll that had little resemblance to the Cisco Voice networking roll I was originally asked to fulfill. I still wanted to work in the Cisco voice world but was thrown into Juniper Firewall environment. I don’t have 1?8th the know-how on Juniper that I have on Cisco. I have 20 years working with Cisco including a degree and certifications. "
5,Training was not sufficient and pay was poor. Initial training was good but product training was poor. When working with customers Apple could do a better job with training.
5,"Ultimately, I’d become a break/fix, technical support engineer working in an foreign environment. I let it be known to my manager I was not happy about this. There was nothing he could do."
5,customer engagement is priority. I learned a lot from this company in terms of customer service and the customer journey. Would recommend anyone to work for this company.
5,Wireless testing and software QA for iPhone and iPads from 3G to 6.  
5,"Constantly reminded that you are only a temporary employee and expendable. toxic work culture, (corporate and management). Fellow employees were amazing, we lifelong friendships. Mostly defending and supporting ourselves from management. The use of languages and co-workers were definitely the high point. Working in a room with so many other cultures; I learned so much from them. Nothing from corporate that I already didn't know, with the exception of their policies, which mostly contradicted other policies and were always changing."
5,"Long days, tough management, culture of diversity and inclusion - The best job you will ever have."
5,"Loved the job, didn't feel like work at all, amazing coworkers(willing to help always). Would love to be working there still but unfortunately, due to personal reasons I couldnt continue my employment there."
5,Enjoyable part is making a difference in the lives of other people
5,Working for Apple is amazing I love working there because the environment. The peers are and managers are an amazing supportive people who motivate you on a daily.
5,Good Place to work as student as pick there own schedule. Good benefits for part time employee. Constant communication with customer oftern leds to frustrating shifts
5,"I had a pretty good experience working for Apple.  Although it was a high stress environment, my team was great and the training was also really thorough!   Stressful but worth it job, most times."
5,Working for apple was amazing. Day to day culture was high paced and stressful however with the help of a perfect system and employees who enforce that system it’s makes everything seem like controlled chaos. This company values its employees and you can tell management is always looking for a way to help instead of pointing the finger. You can genuinely feel supported by this management team. You get compensated well in many ways not including the pay which is well above average.
5,"Apple retail has changed over the past 8 years for the worst. Management is primarily the problem, but the culture too. They claim work-life-balance, yet are very rigid on allowing you the most basic of availability (specific days and times off). Once you reach your pay cap, don't expect much of a raise over time. Also, don't expect much advancement. The advancement that they do offer is a joke, as it is a very short structure, and although it seems like opportunities exist, positions rarely open and when they do, management will tend to be biased on who they choose depending on the store you work in."
5,"Don’t believe the hype. It is a nice place. But they pay terribly. They don’t mind sinking thousands of dollars a day into making sure the stores look and function well, while the employees are starving."
5,"One of my favorite places to work hands down. I thank Apple for all of my life long friendships, experiences, and opportunities to grow personally and professionally."
5,Work 5x8 or 4x10
5,Worked around bereavement leave for me and contacted me several times when a hurricane bit
5,"The people I worked with were great. Its a very crazy, none stop work environment. So if you like that sort of job you will love it. Customers can be hard to deal with sometimes."
5,"The work there was very easy but they do not care about you and don't listen to any of your problems. Since it is a temp job, they will push you aside and will get new people to replace you. You get no paid vacation time and only 24 hours of sick leave."
5,"When you are a contractor, everyday you are reminded how little you matter. No chance of a promotion or contract extension. No raises. Endless work that's incredibly boring. Team leads chosen at random, no hard work incentives. You can't shine here."
5,"I loved my learnings at Apple, I was unwilling to relocate to California. I had a father who was dying of cancer. I choosed to stay in Chicago and travel to my carrier customers. Apple taught me a ton and all will be with me in future roles."
5,Not a very good place to work. Noisy. Aggressive environment.
5,"The culture at the retail level leaves a lot to be desired with regard to the brand that is Apple. The managers are inexperienced micromanagers, with poor communication skills and a sense of entitlement not earned."
5,Very unfriendly towards contractors/vendors. No balance of work and life. 
5,"I enjoyed my time at apple and would have stayed, the only con for me was the constant schedule change. Makes it hard for work/personal life balance.otherwise a great company."
5,"Being subcontracted, like many of the people working under the name Apple, it has a very strong second citizen feeling to it. Very poor benefits, situated in one of the most expensive areas in the city, yet not paying enough to be able to afford food around work."
5,Apple is a great company with boundless of opportunities. The best part is the benefits. Apple offers tuition reimbursement which is for me the greatest perk.
5,Good benefits but low salary and depending on the location parking is expensive!
5,Take all the things you hate and love about retail and multiply them by five.
5,"Very typical retail stuff, just more intense."
5,Management change depending on the location too!
5,I enjoyed my time working at Apple. Specially they did let me work at home since I had a long drive from my home to my work location. I learned a lot during my time at Apple.
5,"A typical day starts with clocking in and quickly checking for any important updates or emails before putting yourself into the queue. Most days were a constant stream of chats, usually 2-3 at once, so it can be pretty frenetic, but you learn a lot about multi-tasking to do well here. There's definitely a lot of opportunity to learn and grow if you're looking to, though they place greater emphasis on soft skills over technical skills. Management can be hit or miss in my several years there, as I had amazing managers who listened and were open to feedback, and some who were more rigid about what they expected. Overall the culture is very much focused on getting the right solution the first time, though with layered issues this can be more complex but that's where senior advisors come in, to take ownership of issues that may take more than one contact to resolve. I think the hardest part of the job were the times that your hands were tied due to policy when it came to resolving some issues and the occasional language barrier problems from non-native English speakers, some of whom used automated translation services to try and troubleshoot issues. But I'd say the best part of the job was being able to fix someone's issue and really make their day by getting their project back on track, or their school assignment, or maybe that amazing scrapbook for a cherished family member or event."
5,"I liked the company it just wasn’t enough hours a week.I was fortunate enough to have a short route and the kids were manageable.The only reason that , I left was for a full time job with great benefits."
5,"It's the kind of place where you punch in, do what you have to do. You make enough money to pay your bills then leave. It's basically the same thing every single day."
5,"Fast paced , working with talented individuals and challenging problems  with a balance of work and life. Enjoy working at Apple and would recommend anyone to join BI team"
5,"I loved my time as a Campus Rep, however the positions basically that of a brand ambassador; interact with the student body, faculty, and staff, repeat. I liked the position and the opportunities that it afforded me, but there was not a lot of opportunity for advancement save for learning about apple and applying to a separate position."
5,I’ve enjoyed working at Apple because their culture is emphasized on creating lifelong skills. We follow a guide to explain the expected competencies in the different roles in the store. This help to promote movement because of the understanding of these competencies. They give you time and offer support to help improve your personal growth.
5,A normal work day is building connections with the people you work with and your customers.  You never had to worry about getting the sell because the product generally sells itself.  You are primarily encouraged to figure out people’s needs and what best suits them.  It is a good mix of fast paced and normal depending on if a product is being released or day of the week.  The hardest part of the job is adapting to situations as they arise.  There is always something new or unexpected and most employees are self starters that are highly adaptable. The most enjoyable part of the job is being getting to Mae the connection with so many people.  Even though I no longer work there I have made life long connections that I may have never of had if it weren’t for apple.
5,Apple stands out as an employer that cares about the wellbeing of its staff. Some of the extra benefits that make it great to work at the Apple Store include:
5,They definitely didn't meet my expectations for such a well know company. I really wish I would have had more assistance and better tools to assist on a daily.
5,"A typical day at work includes finding the perfect solution for any customer's given situation. Whether this includes technical assistance, product knowledge, or the sale of products. I've learned a lot about myself working here. One of the most important skills is being able to function efficiently inside of a loud, stressful environment while providing the best customer service in the industry. Apple has impacted my life in a way that words cannot describe."
5,"apple is an incredible place to work. everyone has the chance to contribute and make a difference the pace is fast, the work is never boring and everyone is passionate about making the customer experience match the product excellence."
5,Management are quite oblivious to everything except the overall score of each worker and do not really care for the advisors but only if their customers are appeased.
5,"Overall, Apple is a decent temporary job. You come in and work the same task everyday for two weeks, you move over a station and then the same process. You are most likely to learn something new when it comes to a job/role/position switch within the workplace, which may be the 'hardest' part of the job. Once you are trained by you're supervisor your everyday task will go smooth."
5,"With an incredibly competent management staff and a company with clear cut goals, mission and initiative, working at Apple Retail was arguably the best work experience ive ever been a part of. Employee comfort and understanding came first and the customer satisfaction was on the forefront of the goals. Would highly reccomend to anyone in the retail field."
5,I left it for career avancement opportunities but ultimately realize now that an individual contributor role can pay nearly as well as management opportunities elsewhere while affording you the freedom to live your life off the clock.
5,"I worked as an Apple Technical Specialist at the Genius Bar. I was treated horribly by management because i was older and didn’t get involved with outside activities with other employees. I was severely micromanaged and my job was under threat constantly by managers who were biased against me. I played by the rules and was penalized for it because the other techs knew how to cheat the system. I love the products and the company overall, but the management style  (Fearless feedback that you are not allowed to defend yourself against is a nightmare) I was never given a chance to defend myself or dispute their assessment of my performance, which they base in unrealistic metrics that even they cannot live up to."
5,Promotions are hard to come by. Tends to be favoritism vs readiness
5,"Apple is a great place to work. You have a friendly and helping environment. The culture here is welcoming to all! I have had opportunity to grow and learn, but did have to pave my own path to do so."
5,"Unfortunately, when I moved to a work from home position there was not much room for advancement and I moved out of Texas so I could not go back on-site."
5,"Enjoyed the people and fun place to work overall. As long as you do your job and learn and grow, things typically go smoothly. The management provided good feedback and helped you by providing tools necessary to grow.."
5,Every minor change required a review by many people. It was hard to focus on the creative because it felt like we were pushing work through a sieve of groupthink.
5,I do not work at apple I just have training with the apple products which is nice I appreciate the fact that I am able to learn things that usually only the apple reps learn from apple
5,"Loved working for them! The only complaint i have is the work/home balance. They provided excellent training and continued education about products,policy and procedures."
5,"This was the easiest job I ever had but it was my first job, so I did not realize that fact. Most of my coworkers were cool people- A mix of kids starting their first job, like myself, and retired folk making extra scratch. Most of the staff sipped the koolaid on Apple as a brand, and that mentality gets old after a bit. Tech nerd/know-it-alls and kids who think they're going on to bigger, better things are often attracted to Apple Retail...so you've been warned. I left because I wanted full-time employment, and this store was fully staffed in that regard. Most of the time it was a revolving door of workers, so never assume anyone is essential."
5,"All of Apple is not 'Apple Proper'. A data center in Maiden, NC is not the same as working in Cupertino. It is different. The culture of Apple depends on where the DC is located."
5,Everything was good. Nothing bad to say about this company. The benefits were great. Compensation was compatible and actually allowed me to maintain a balanced lifestyle.
5,Stay away from this company but not their products. They pick favorites early on and treat them like kings and queens. This should be enough info to suit your needs.
5,The phones get very fun at some moments but the management isn’t too good they treat everyone like trash.
5,Apple values people as much as their innovative culture and products. They do a fine job of hiring the right people and training new hires before they're sent out on the floor.
5,Great opportunity to advance your skills. A lot of pros for the environment working from home. Very nice place to grow and lean more about yourself and your strengths.
5,Great place to learn skills for a future career.  I would recommend anyone take this job.  You must stay focused be on time and a team player.  It can be challenging but a great job
5,I have never worked with a more intelligent and conscientious group of people. I loved working at Apple. I would highly recommend the experience for anyone who ha a passion for Apple Technology.
5,They help with anything you need and have great training!  The only thing that I didn't like was that your work schedule was under a shift bid system.
5,"Apple has excellent benefits and employees have a wealth of benefit-related resources available to them. Depending on the department, there can be a lot of opportunity for career advancement."
5,"Apple is everything that we know. A company that builds some of the best products on the planet. This drives their culture and as long as you fit and follow along, you will be happy. don't try to change Apple, learn to conform and you will be happy. Overall a great company."
5,"Apple not only cares about their employees, they are very helpful and will guide you to glory. I’ve enjoyed every moment at Apple. Time off or sick leave was allowed upon request"
5,"Genius Admin is one of the most stressful jobs at Apple. I would encourage any roll but Genius Admin. Overall, you get paid great for Retail. Great benefits."
5,Apple was definitely an immersive experience. Apple is a company that is truly dedicated to it's clients as well as employees. The hardest part of working with Apple is the quick pace environment. Apple never slows down. The most enjoyable part of apple is the diversity of it's employees.
5,Company is a good company.  Very fast paced. Meet new and wonderful people.  Always learning. It’s an environment of the people. Great benefits. Make lifelong friends
5,"The majority of Apple's employees at the Austin campus are contractors. They're thrown into helpdesk positions with little to no protection from the departmental politics above them. Workflows, rules and enforcement all change with alarming regularity, and workers caught out of line for any reason are treated as disposable. Your entire experience is dictated by the mood of your manager and their manager. Few, if any of those hired as contractors are hired on full-time."
5,"This and most reviews of Apple are very team dependent, as individual teams tend to - in large part - dictate their own day to day operations and culture. That being said, as a newer developer on a small team, I have received a lot of help and guidance from management and more senior developers. This is double-edged sword, however, as I also have virtually nothing to do with decisions that get made, am not privy to many decisions that get made by higher ups, and it's easy to feel like a cog in the machine."
5,"Great company and amazing benefits, very welcoming in trying to make sure you are comfortable and happy. "
5,"Confronted with way too many poor managers while in my role. Some are outstanding, but too many somehow got through the cracks and were left unchecked."
5,"fun and the people I worked with were the best, I've worked at many jobs and this one was the best which made it difficult to leave. but the exigence was worth it"
5,Great Place to work with team building and most of all selling the greatest products on earth!
5,"pay may not be as great for technical positions but the culture , and benefits are amazing. Great medical plans  even if part time, great medical plans for families with kids."
5,"Technical calls, high emphasis on metrics, subpar training. Room for advancement if you are successful on the phones/chats. Must be able to adapt to change."
5,That it was good pay 8hours 13.50 five days a week n Saturday was over time I work night shift 8pm to 4:30am in the moring was told about it from a friend
5,"Apple treats its employees extremely well. My only qualm was with opportunities for advancement. While opportunities were plentiful, it was hard to advance in my particular location and I wasn’t prepared to move. Overall it was wonderful though. The benefits are amazing and they offer paid new parent leave. This latter benefit was surprisingly something I was eligible for when we started foster care and when we later adopted the kids we fostered Apple reimbursed us for those expenses too."
5,"At the beginning of each day we would have store meetings.  We were updated on the latest news and products.  During the shift itself, we would provide recommendations and solutions to customers.  Our management team would assist with questions in an appropriate manner to both employees and customers.  The culture of the store was very open minded and full of self expression.  The most enjoyable part of working at Apple were the customers and co workers you interacted with everyday.  Each customer had a unique story, and each employee was fun in their own way."
5,I loved working for Apple Inc.  Management truly cares about their employees and were always there to help you regardless if it was work related or personal life situations.  I wish I never left but I needed full time hours.
5,I was hired through a temp agency so I did not receive the same pay or options actual Apple employees did but I enjoyed working there and it was a fun environment. I think they do an awesome job at training their new recruits and there is room to move up within the company.
5,Very fun place to work for and very nice management. Pay is good and more than the average hourly rate from other retail stores. Hours are very flexible.
5,"I was responsible for managing computer parts for repair. The bad parts were sent in we turned around and gave customer good parts to repair customers PC. I worked for distrubtion and sales sometimes. I helped set up warehouse, drove forklift, and helped ship parts to vendors,"
5,"Nees to up their wages for home advisors , but the trainer was 5 star, loved working with my team, and I learned ALOT. Would of loved to stay with the company but my salary wasnt enough."
5,"Apple treats their employees like family. There’s always room for improvement if you want it for yourself, Apple will provide the means to get you there."
5,"It was a great company to start working for our of college. I would highly recommend working for them. The pros were we had a cafeteria on campus, people were enjoyable to work with. I felt accepted."
5,Love this company and how they build their culture and people. Great to work for.
5,Apple's strongest suit is their benefits. They are truly second to none.
5,Great environment if a little stressful at times. Corporate vision and meeting atmosphere is a bit cultish. People are generally fun and easy to be around.
5,Cool place to work with really smart folks aligned to deliver an exceptional customer experience.  Customer is always first and the teams are focused on exceeding expectations.
5,"Good pay but it can very stressful job. Very high volume in traffic. Management is okay. It could be better. The company has a fun workplace culture. They are very accepting of everyone and their individuality. Training is okay, but they teach you more about their culture than what you'll actually be doing when you start working. Overall, this job is not for everybody but you'll definitely learn a lot."
5,Working at Apple was a great experience. Most people are more than willing to help you learn and the benefits are amazing. The only downside is that the job can feel extremely demanding at times. The position I worked in allowed me to work from home and this led to a very poor work-life balance.
5,good company good benefits.  I was with the company for 5 years and it was a great experience.  Most admired company in the world and it showed. People and culture are strong
5,Its fun place but to chance to grow your career ...So I will sujggest this place for work but not for them who wants to make their career .Because in this place no chanve to grow at all ..
5,"Pretty good position, pays wells and has a lot of flexibility. I personally loved all the gifts and free stuff that we got through the online portal. Miss working there."
5,"The callers loved Apple, maybe 60-80% were happy, which is amazing. Very challenging, extremely steep learning curve. iLog software worked fairly well. It was impossible to find a customer's notes on previous calls, without customer providing information first."
5,"While I'm sure that many people's experience will differ from mine, I had a very positive experience. I transition out of academic life and found the atmosphere to be as personally engaging as teaching. And there was always the challenge to grow professionally. Many of the development, training, and organizational skills I learned as a Specialist and then as an Expert have served me well to this very day."
5,Apple is a great company for nearly anyone that have a passion for technology. I enjoyed my time working there. So much growth in the company. A lot of enjoyable work to go around.
5,"Multi tasking, fast pace on the fly work environment. Working with many personalitys to say the least. Working on prototypes. Performing various builds and installs."
5,"The apple store is the best place to work. I look forward to going to work every day to see my friends, which include my managers and my fellow co-workers. The work is fun because you get to meet many new people and help them fix their phones, leaving them happy usually. There are some challenges but the team always helps you work through them."

5,Onsite technical consultant for enterprise business customers
5,"Great company with some challenges, but shows that they care for its people and tries to promote internal advancement."
5,"Apple is great if you want to work for a company with no morals regarding people protection. The management is over paid and under performs, and does not support pursuit of greatness."
5,"I worked in the Retail stores and often times it took time away from family due to the hours, but at least you were compensated for this time and management was flexible with scheduling."
5,"Competitive Pay, Great Benefits, Amazing People, Great Work, Awesome Opportunities, Excellent Experiences, Great atmospheres , no matter where you're working!"
5,"Stores are filled with amazing employees, opportunities to advance. Fast paced environment and builds networking/social skills quickly. Great benefits and perks, however make sure you get lots of rest, your day can be filled with nonstop talking, emotional distress from customers and conflict management"
